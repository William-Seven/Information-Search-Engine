Description:

<span>Hinduism is among the most ancient spiritual traditions globally, encompassing knowledge that transcends its religious and philosophical dimensions, extending into the realm of science. Texts such as the Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and various Puranas represent a profound repository of knowledge that articulates scientific methodologies and principles, which remarkably line up with contemporary scientific discoveries made millennia later. This research endeavors to elucidate scientific concepts embedded within the sacred wisdom of Hindu philosophical texts and symbols, encompassing cosmology, time, consciousness, and ecology.
</span><span>Mayas examines the cyclical nature of time and the universe in Hindu cosmology, correlating it with contemporary theories regarding the origin and evolution of the universe, as well as the concept of multiverse. It also investigates the mind-body connection as articulated in practices such as yoga, meditation, and Ayurveda, and their relevance to modern neuroscience and consciousness studies. Furthermore, the study delves into Hindu ecological values, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all life forms and Ahimsa (non-violence), and how these principles can make clear current environmental challenges.
</span><span>This study analyzes intersections that demonstrate the enduring wisdom of Hinduism and its relevance to modern scientific discourse. By juxtaposing ancient and contemporary worldviews, the study aims to illuminate the dual pathways through which humanity can comprehend and articulate its existence, potentially fostering a synthesis of knowledge that reconciles these seemingly disparate realms of understanding.</span>&nbsp;
