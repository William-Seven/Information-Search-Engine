<em><span>Industrialization has significantly impacted tribal communities, particularly in regions where traditional livelihoods depend on natural resources. This study examines the effects of Industrialization on tribal livelihoods in Dindori Taluka, focusing on Ashewadi and Dhakambe villages. While Industrialization fosters economic growth through employment generation, infrastructure development, and improved living standards, it also introduces socio-economic vulnerabilities such as displacement, marginalization, and cultural erosion. Dindori&rsquo;s emerging industries, including food processing, textiles, and pharmaceuticals, present opportunities and challenges for local tribal populations. Using a random sampling method, 1.27% of the 158 villages were selected, with 15 tribal respondents from each Village participating in the study. Demographic analysis revealed gender imbalances, with males comprising 53% in Ashewadi and 60% in Dhakambe, which may influence labour distribution and social structures.</span></em>


<em><span>Additionally, age distribution varies between villages; Ashewadi has a predominant 26-45 age group, indicating a workforce-driven population. Dhakambe exhibits a more balanced age structure, suggesting greater social and economic dynamism. This study highlights the need for policies that balance economic progress with tribal welfare, ensuring inclusive and sustainable development. Understanding demographic patterns and their implications is crucial for mitigating Industrialization&rsquo;s adverse effects and promoting tribal community resilience.</span></em>
