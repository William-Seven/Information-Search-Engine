Description:

Inspired by Zimmermann (2019) who dared to take on the task to model Spanish
verbal inflection within a declarative approach to morphology, the present 
contribution seeks to do something similar with respect to Slovak. The paper provides
readers with basic facts about Slovak phonology and verbal paradigms, outlines
the essentials of the framework, and tries to reconstruct how (first- and second-
language) learners of Slovak are likely to deduce word-schemas (generalizations)
on the basis of the input they are exposed to. Ultimately, a moderate word-form
lexicon is suggested to be the most cognitively realistic scenario of lexical access.
