Description:

<span lang="EN-IN">Mobile Ad-hoc network (MANET) is infrastructure less network in which nodes are mobile, self reconfigurable, battery powered. As nodes in MANET are battery powered, energy saving is an important issue. We are using routing protocol to save energy so as to extend network lifetime. We have extended original Optimized Linked State Routing (OLSR) protocol by using two algorithms and named it as Enhancement in OLSR using Residual Energy approach (EOLSR-RE) and Enhancement in OLSR using Energy Consumption approach (EOLSR-EC). To analyze relative performance of modified protocol EOLSR-RE and EOLSR-EC over OLSR, we performed various trials using Qualnet simulator. The performance of these routing protocols is analyzed in terms of energy consumption, control overheads, end to end delay, packet delivery ratio. The modified OLSR protocol improves energy efficiency of network by reducing 20 % energy consumption and 50% control overheads.</span>
