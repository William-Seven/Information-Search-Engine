Description:
<p dir="ltr">This book offers a comprehensive exploration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) as an interdisciplinary field integrating Computer Science, Linguistics, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning. It elucidates NLP's core function in enabling computers to comprehend, analyze, manipulate, and interpret human languages, highlighting diverse applications such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, chatbots, and speech recognition. The text details NLP's components, Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG), along with the five crucial steps involved in processing natural language: lexical, syntactic, semantic, discourse, and pragmatic analysis. Furthermore, the book delves into the structural aspects of words, including morphology, tokens, and lexemes, and provides practical guidance on text preprocessing tasks using Python's NLTK package, covering tokenization, stop word filtering, stemming, POS tagging, and lemmatization. A significant portion is dedicated to syntax analysis, explaining parsing, parse trees, and various grammar types like Dependency Grammar and Phrase Structure Grammar, along with parsing algorithms and methods for ambiguity resolution. Throughout, the book emphasizes the transformative impact of Deep Learning models, including RNNs, Transformers, CNNs, DNNs, and large language models like GPT and BERT, on advancing NLP capabilities.
