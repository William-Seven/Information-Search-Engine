<span lang="EN">ABSTRACT</span>


<span lang="EN">The dissemination of scientific knowledge has long been a secondary or even neglected aspect within the academic sphere. To overcome this scenario, scientific dissemination has gradually emerged as a movement for transmitting scientific knowledge in a unidirectional and vertical model, in which the scientist assumes the role of sender and the general public that of receiver. More recently, however, scientific dissemination has progressed toward a dialogical and participatory approach &ndash; namely, a bidirectional and horizontal model. The field of Linguistics, however, still faces challenges due to its historical constitution as a science marked by the distancing of those considered laypersons. In this context, UNESCO World Atlas of Languages emerges as an instrument for the popularization of linguistic knowledge, promoting awareness of linguistic diversity and the participation of a previously overlooked public. Thus, this article aims to discuss UNESCO World Atlas of Languages as a tool for the popularization of Linguistics, specifically regarding its methodology of collaborative production between researchers and the non-linguist public &ndash; a public that often consists of speakers of marginalized languages under the monolingual conception established and reinforced in Brazil.</span>
