Description:

The present contribution concerns the German correlate es and its suppletive
forms, in comparison with Russian to in various case forms, as they show up in
temporal adverbial clauses. The morphosyntactic and semantic structures of
&nbsp;temporal connectives and the relation of temporal clauses to prepositional phrases
with proforms and to DPs with relative clauses will be considered.



It is argued that temporal clauses are modifiers of type ⟨it⟩ and that many of them
contain a relative clause as modifier of a suitable head noun. The correlate func-
tions as a cataphoric entity and is characterized as a definite non-deictic determiner
with an additional position for an explicative modifier.
