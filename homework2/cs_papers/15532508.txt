Cloud computing has revolutionized data management, creating demand for highly scalable and adaptive database systems. Traditional architecture has given way to cloud-native databases that offer elasticity, modularity, and real-time responsiveness. This paper reviews modern approaches to building scalable cloud databases, highlighting critical challenges and emerging solutions. Key advancements include microservices-based architecture and intelligent tuning systems like CDBTune and HUNTER, which use AI to optimize performance under dynamic workloads. Security is addressed through homomorphic encryption, blockchain, and oblivious data structures, ensuring data protection in untrusted environments. The study also examines migration strategies and middleware for cross-platform interoperability between SQL and NoSQL systems. Application use cases across agriculture, IoT, healthcare, and industrial domains illustrate practical impacts. Benchmarking approaches focus on latency, throughput, and cost-efficiency. By analyzing over 40 research sources, this paper provides actionable best practices for designing resilient, secure, and efficient cloud database solutions that meet the demands of today&rsquo;s data-intensive world.
