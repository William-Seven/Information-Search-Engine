Description:

<em><span>This paper explores the significant role of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in promoting women's empowerment and achieving gender equality. With a focus on key areas such as education, employment, entrepreneurship, health, and leadership, it examines how CSR initiatives contribute to reducing gender disparities and fostering inclusive economic growth. The study highlights notable case studies of companies that have implemented successful women-centric CSR programs, including Tata Steel&rsquo;s Tejaswini Project, Hindustan Unilever&rsquo;s Project Shakti, and Coca-Cola&rsquo;s 5by20 initiative. Additionally, the paper reviews global frameworks and guidelines, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 5) and the UN Women&rsquo;s Empowerment Principles (WEPs), which provide strategic direction for gender-responsive corporate policies.</span></em>


<em><span>Despite the progress made, challenges such as inadequate monitoring, lack of standardized impact assessment metrics, and corporate resistance to gender-focused initiatives persist. The paper emphasizes the need for stronger public-private partnerships, greater corporate accountability, and the integration of CSR with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals. It also advocates for the use of technology-driven solutions for impact measurement and expanding access to resources for women entrepreneurs.</span></em>

<em><span>Ultimately, this study underscores that CSR is not merely a philanthropic obligation but a strategic approach to drive sustainable development and equitable growth. By committing to gender-inclusive CSR initiatives, corporations can play a pivotal role in advancing women's empowerment and contributing to a more inclusive society.</span></em>
