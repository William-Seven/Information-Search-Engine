Description:

This dataset provides the complete enumeration of connected graph isomers with 5 to 11 vertices.
Each isomer is represented by a base-36 encoded string of its adjacency matrix, with isomorphic duplicates removed.
For n = 11, the data is split by edge count into separate ZIP files due to size limitations.
The dataset is intended for research in graph theory, chemical graph analysis, and algorithm benchmarking.
Accompanying scripts and usage documentation are included for decoding and interpretation.
