<span lang="EN-GB">This study comprehensively examines the profound technological and methodological synergies existing between observations made via interferometric detectors such as LIGO and Virgo, which have revolutionized the field of gravitational wave (GW) astrophysics, and the rapidly advancing quantum computing (QC) technologies. As both disciplines aim to perform measurements pushing the limits of precision, the effective control and mitigation of environmental and quantum-originated noise pose a critical challenge. In this context, the quantum squeezing technique stands out as a fundamental tool in both domains, employed to reduce measurement uncertainty below the quantum limit in GW detectors and to enhance the sensitivity of quantum bits (qubits) in QCs. Carlton Caves' pioneering 1980 paper [1] first theoretically established the inevitable presence of quantum mechanical radiation pressure fluctuations in laser interferometers and their impact on measurement sensitivity, thereby laying the groundwork for integrating quantum optics principles into high-precision metrology. This theoretical framework has also provided the intellectual basis for quantum noise reduction strategies developed to enhance the sensitivity of GW detectors. Similarly, Peter Shor's development of quantum error correction (QEC) codes in 1996 [3] represented a landmark, offering a solution to decoherence and operational errors&mdash;one of the biggest obstacles for QCs&mdash;and paving the way for scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computation. The present work meticulously compares the parallel technological advancements and conceptual intersections in these two pioneering fields, highlighting a rich interdisciplinary potential that can yield mutual benefits and inspire innovative solutions. In this vein, the study analyses the historical evolution and current technological challenges of both GW observations and QCs, while also envisioning potential future areas of interaction and collaboration&mdash;such as advanced sensors, novel signal processing algorithms, and the application of quantum information theory to physical systems&mdash;thereby aiming to establish a solid foundation for a deeper and more fruitful integration of quantum technologies in these two distinct yet complementary domains.</span>
