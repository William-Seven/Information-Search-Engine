Description:

<em><span lang="EN-US">One of the most crucial elements of mobile robotics is obstacle avoidance. Robot movement would be extremely limited and delicate without it. The robotic vehicle proposed in this research is intelligent enough to steer itself when it encounters an obstacle. Therefore, to shield the robot from any harm. This might be used to create a robotic vehicle that avoids obstacles by moving with the help of ultrasonic sensors. The AT mega 328P microcontroller is utilized to accomplish the intended function. Any obstacles in front of it are detected by an ultrasonic sensor, which then instructs the microcontroller. By activating the motors that are connected to it via a motor driver, the micro-controller reroutes the robot to travel in a different direction based on the input signal received.</span></em>
