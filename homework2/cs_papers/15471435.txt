Description:

This contribution deals with the attributive pronouns kakoj and čto za in interrogative
and exclamative sentences of Russian. It is an investigation into the 
polyfunctionality of these expressions, their integration into the DP structure, and their
interplay with sentence mood. The morphosyntactic and semantic properties of
these lexical items will be considered within the framework of Chomsky&rsquo;s 
Minimalist Program, taking into account their semantic form and conceptual structure.
