<strong><span>Abstract</span></strong>


<span>The spiritual and philosophical perspective of water in Vedic tradition reflects the symbolic and spiritual significance of purity, creation, transformation, and the divineness. Water is more than a physical substance rather it has sacred elements that connects life, the cosmos, and the divine order. </span><span>In Vedic literature, water is referred as Apah, literally means Water. </span><span>Interestingly, the Persian word for water, "Ab," is identical to the Sanskrit "Ap," demonstrating a shared linguistic and cultural heritage. In the Vedas, water was revered both as a feminine entity and, in some hymns, as a divine lord. Depending on its diverse functions and attributes, ancient sages invoked water under different names.</span>


<span>Water is the essence of life, a sustaining force that protects both the living and the departed. It is considered the primary source of energy and existence. Vedic texts classify water into two categories: terrestrial and celestial. Various water deities, such as Indra and Parjanya, are associated with its divine aspects. The Vedas are regarded as the ultimate source of wisdom. According to Vedic texts, before creation took place, the universe was filled with dormant cosmic particles containing inherent potential for activity. Ancient Vedic sages, possessing profound wisdom and a highly scientific perspective, deeply analyzed the fundamental forces of creation. Through their refined intellect and investigative approach, they studied the energy dynamics in the universe, including the five gross elements one of which is water. Water is identified as a crucial energy element in the process of creation. This research paper highlights the vital role of water as depicted in Vedic scriptures. This paper explores Vedic Cosmology and the significance of water in Vedic literature</span>
