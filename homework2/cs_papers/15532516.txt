Due to the limited availability of comprehensive data on retail and online trade, particularly in developing countries, this study synthesizes insights from various sources to analyze trends worldwide. With a particular emphasis on Canada, this research investigates the origins of commerce and e-commerce, the role of the internet in its expansion, and the challenges that persist. Additionally, it examines the impact of e-commerce on businesses, consumers, and third parties, assessing how these effects vary across different economies.</span></em>

<em><span>The study also aims to determine whether differences in the purchase and consumption of goods across countries are influenced by national characteristics. Using international trade data, it evaluates the proportion of e-commerce in total retail sales and how these metrics affect global trends. The findings reveal patterns that policymakers often overlook, offering multiple avenues for further research. Given e-commerce&rsquo;s continued potential for growth, a better understanding of its dynamics can contribute to a more accurate depiction of the digital marketplace.</span></em>
