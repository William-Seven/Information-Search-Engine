Description:

<span lang="EN-GB">The current state of Scots pine (<em>Pinus sylvestris</em> L.) stands and forest regeneration processes on reclaimed sites, as well as the impact of forestry activities on the formation of native pine stands in fresh subors of the Zhytomyr Polissia, have been investigated. The study was conducted in the Shershnivske Forestry of the Korosten Forest District, a branch of the &ldquo;Capital Forest Office&rdquo; of the State Enterprise &ldquo;Forests of Ukraine&rdquo;. The dynamics of silvicultural and forest inventory indicators over a 50-year period were analysed. Methodologies from comparative ecology, forest science, silviculture, botany, and forest inventory were applied.</span>


<span lang="EN-GB">It was established that there has been a change in forest types from dry pine forest (A1C) to fresh oak-pine subor (B2DS). The stand composition changed from 7Pine+2Birch+1Small-leaved lime to 10Pine+Birch and 9Pine+1Sycamore maple+Birch. It was found that the presence of deciduous species in the stand increases the resilience of Scots pine to forest diseases, and the productivity indicators of these stands are 3.3&ndash;15.0% higher compared to simple-structured and pure pine stands.</span>
