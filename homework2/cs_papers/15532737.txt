Description:

This systematic literature review delves into various wood waste valorization and classification approaches, aiming to evaluate their efficacy in fostering sustainable wood resource management while enhancing the economic value of wood waste. By synthesizing findings from a diverse array of research studies, the review highlights the multifaceted nature of wood waste valorization, emphasizing the critical role of sorting and separation technologies in ensuring high-quality recovery of materials.  It also identifies the wood classification practices in Europe, which are crucial for creating a harmonized valorization framework that aligns technological advancements with regulatory standards. The analysis reveals that integrating these componentsâ€”technologies, sorting methods, and classification practices can significantly improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of wood waste management. Furthermore, the review identifies existing gaps in research and practice, providing actionable recommendations for stakeholders aiming to optimize wood valorization waste systems. These recommendations emphasize the necessity for a holistic approach and a clearly defined, comprehensive framework for wood valorization that considers all elements involved in the process. By addressing these areas, the review not only aims to contribute to the body of knowledge in wood waste valorization but also seeks to promote sustainable practices that benefit both the environment and the economy, paving the way for a more circular approach to wood resource utilization.

This systematic literature review examines various approaches to wood waste valorization and classification, with the aim of evaluating their effectiveness in promoting sustainable wood resource management and increasing the economic value of wood waste. The review focuses on technologies for valorizing wood waste from construction, demolition, and furniture, with attention to treatment methods, key technologies like sorting and separation, and best practices, while also identifying challenges, opportunities, and research gaps that could support sustainable wood resource management and a circular economy.

A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach was employed to comprehensively assess valorization technologies for wood waste derived from construction, demolition, and furniture waste, following the methodology outlined by 
                    Harris 
                        et al. (2013). The review addresses the research question: What wood valorization technologies (for both pure and mixed treatment) are currently available, and what criteria should be considered when selecting a valorization route? To answer this question, contextual keywords were carefully analyzed and structured into a search query with three levels. A search string was developed using Boolean operators, and filters were applied based on article types and inclusion criteria. A total of 152 papers were identified from searches conducted in Science Direct and Scopus, following the PRISMA review technique to ensure transparency and repeatability.

The findings highlight the current state of research in wood valorization and classification, revealing significant gaps in the comprehensive exploration of technologies, sorting methods, and classification frameworks. The need for further development in integrating classification and valorization strategies to achieve sustainable wood management is emphasized. The strength of evidence is high, as despite the challenges posed by the limited number of scholarly papers, valuable and relevant insights were successfully drawn from the available literature. The refined search query navigated these constraints by effectively balancing specificity and breadth, revealing critical gaps in the field and providing a robust foundation for understanding current knowledge. This approach not only enhances the understanding of wood waste valorization but also helps inform future research directions.

 In conclusion, wood valorization technologies have the potential to greatly improve resource efficiency, economic growth, and environmental sustainability by converting wood waste into valuable products. However, the successful implementation of these technologies requires addressing key challenges, such as sorting, separation, and harmonizing classification schemes. Looking ahead, a holistic approach is needed that integrates supply chain management, financial considerations, and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to optimize both the environmental and economic viability of valorization processes. A comprehensive framework that incorporates these elements will support sustainable practices and contribute to a circular economy within the wood industry, using this study as preliminary step.
