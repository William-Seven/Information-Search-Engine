Description:

A plethora of volunteer projects aim to make Belgian historic sources of person observations&nbsp;searchable in the online environment of the State Archives. However, these projects are scattered, incomplete and of varying quality. Access to the entire IIIF-collection of scans is restricted and the link between person data and scans was lost. Meanwhile, Belgium is lagging behind in reconstructing historical life courses compared to the Netherlands, even though the sources are similar. The Persons in Contect (PiCo) ontology can support the standardisation and publication of historical person data as Linked Data. We propose working on basic infrastructure to model and link data into person reconstructions, and correct and validate information automatically or manually.
