Description:

<em><span>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD&rsquo;s) are disorder of the heart and blood arteries that are becoming a major cause of death and a global issue. Several aspects of the CVD epidemic in India are particularly worrying, including its rapid increase, the early onset of disease in the population, and the high case fatality rate. Statistical analysis is essential for predicting and detecting the risk of cardiovascular diseases, helping to raise awareness among the public. In healthcare sector, there is wealth of available data, but is the need to extract correct information from it to enhance medication discovery, diagnosis, treatment and overall care. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps in understanding the insights of dataset. In this research paper, we have used publically available UCI (University of California, Irvine) heart disease dataset for study. These findings provide valuable insights into the epidemiology of CVD and can inform targeted interventions for its prevention and management.</span></em>
