Description:

<strong>Abstract: </strong>The COVID-19 pandemic has posed an ongoing challenge for public health systems around the globe. Accurate forecasting of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia has remained critical for informed planning and timely interventions. This research explores and compares the predictive performance of two artificial neural network models&mdash;Nonlinear Autoregressive Neural Network (NNAR) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)&mdash;applied to Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s COVID-19 case data from March 2020 through December 2021. Using standard evaluation metrics, including MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and Theil&rsquo;s U, the study demonstrates that the NNAR model provides slightly more stable and accurate predictions in short-term horizons than LSTM. While LSTM models are known for capturing complex temporal patterns, our findings suggest that NNAR may offer a more robust option in volatile epidemiological conditions. These insights contribute to the growing field of epidemic forecasting and provide practical considerations for health policymakers in the region.
