Description:

<strong>Abstract: </strong>This research assessed the contribution of e-banking systems' reliability to revenue collection within higher learning institutions, specifically focusing on Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College. Anchored in Electronic Payment Theory, the study aimed to assess the reliability, convenience, and accessibility of the e-banking system and their collective contributions to enhancing revenue collection efficiency. A mixedmethods research approach was employed, combining interviews, questionnaires, and documentary reviews. Key stakeholders, including students and finance officers, were engaged to gather comprehensive data. This approach facilitated a detailed analysis of how e-banking systems contribute to revenue collection in the context of higher education. A pilot study involved a selected sample subset and was crucial for identifying potential issues with the survey questionnaire and interview protocols. Notably, the reliability of the data collected during the pilot phase was rigorously assessed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient test, a statistical measure of internal consistency. The results were promising, with a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.704, indicating a good level of reliability, affirming the instruments' ability to measure the variables of interest consistently. Data Analysis involved both descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings indicated high satisfaction with the system&rsquo;s reliability, particularly its capability to handle high transaction volumes during peak periods and its robust security measures safeguarding user transactions, contributing to revenue collection significantly at p-value &lt; 0.05. The study concluded that the e-banking system's reliability is crucial in optimising revenue collection processes. It is recommended that regular updates, an enhanced user interface based on feedback, expanded technical support, and continuous improvement in security measures be implemented to maintain and improve system efficiency.
