<span><span><span><span><span>C</span></span><span><span>osmological models derived from fundamental physics often present a universe perceived </span></span><span><span>as </span></span><span><span>ultimately meaningless, leading to a sense of existential disconnection. This paper critiques this "mask" of the universe characterized by determinism or randomness, inevitable heat death, </span></span><span><span>or</span></span><span><span> unknown "dark" components, arguing </span></span><span><span>that </span></span><span><span>it is scientifically incomplete for understanding complex</span></span><span><span>ity and </span></span><span><span>the</span></span><span><span> richness of cosmic evolution</span></span><span><span>. As an alternative, </span></span><span><span>I propose</span></span><span><span> a new cosmological "mask" that integrates insights from complexity and evolutionary sciences. This enriched worldview shifts focus from static entities and fundamental forces to dynamic processes, emergence, information flow, and potential directionality. </span></span><span><span>I discuss</span></span><span><span> concepts such as </span></span><span><span>complexification in</span></span><span><span> cosmic evolution, non-equilibrium thermodynamics as an engine of order, Evo Devo </span></span><span><span>C</span></span><span><span>osmology balancing predictability and randomness, a hopeful perspective on astrobiology, and the </span></span><span><span>thought provoking</span></span><span><span> idea of cosmological artificial selection by intelligence. Crucially, the paper reinterprets teleology not as supernatural design but as naturalistic goal-directedness, </span></span><span><span>using the framework of</span></span><span><span> attractors in dynamical systems, </span></span><span><span>thus</span></span><span><span> allowing for a scientifically grounded understanding of purpose and direction in the universe. </span></span><span><span>This </span></span><span><span>new</span></span><span><span> cosmological worldview</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>is not only scientifically richer, but it </span></span><span><span>can </span></span><span><span>also </span></span><span><span>foster a more meaningful connection, offer a source of inspiration, and </span></span><span><span>even </span></span><span><span>provide a </span></span><span><span>broader</span></span><span><span> framework for navigating planetary challenges.</span></span></span></span></span>
