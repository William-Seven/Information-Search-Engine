Description:

<em><span>In India, digital marketing has witnessed significant growth in the past decade, with businesses adopting various strategies to enhance their reach and engagement with consumers. Traditional digital advertising, which includes banner ads, search engine marketing (SEM), and pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, has been a dominant marketing approach for years. However, the increasing use of social media has led to the rise of influencer marketing, which involves collaborations with social media personalities to promote products and services.</span></em>


<em><span>The effectiveness of these two approaches varies based on factors such as consumer trust, engagement rates, cost-effectiveness, and return on investment (ROI). Traditional digital advertising provides structured targeting and large-scale reach, but ad fatigue, ad blockers, and declining consumer trust have reduced its effectiveness. In contrast, influencer marketing leverages personal relationships between influencers and their audiences, resulting in higher engagement and better conversion rates.</span></em>
