Description:

This study aims to examine the influence of field study learning methods and learning motivation on improving student learning outcomes in the Basic Hospitality subject at Vocational High Schools (SMK). The background of this research is based on the phenomenon of low student learning outcomes, characterized by a lack of conceptual understanding, low participation in practice, and poor learning motivation. This research employs a literature study approach with content analysis techniques applied to various relevant journals, books, and scientific articles. The findings indicate that the field study learning method provides contextual and authentic learning experiences that can enhance students&rsquo; practical skills, conceptual understanding, and professional attitudes. On the other hand, learning motivation is an internal psychological factor that drives students&rsquo; active engagement in the learning process and contributes to optimal learning outcomes. These findings are supported by previous studies that show a positive correlation between the two variables and students' learning outcomes in vocational schools. Therefore, the systematic implementation of field study methods and efforts to enhance learning motivation are essential strategies for improving the quality of vocational education in SMKs.
