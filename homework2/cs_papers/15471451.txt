Description:

In this chapter, building on Mathieu (2014), we put forth a split analysis of plural
number. More precisely, we argue that functional morphemes can be polysemous.
Different positions in the syntactic structure correlate with different 
interpretations. In other words, the plural is distributed along the syntactic spine and may
realize three different functional heads in the fine-grained DP-structure: n0 (a low
functional head), Div0 (a middle functional head), and #0 (a high functional head).
We present evidence based on the plural marking in Russian and Polish 
showing that also in Slavic languages the plural comes in many guises, which justifies
proposing different syntactic positions for its different semantic manifestations.
We refer to this observation as the &ldquo;distributed plural hypothesis.&rdquo; Altogether we
argue, based on the facts discussed in the chapter, that the assumption of a 
fine-grained DP-structure is justified in Russian and Polish, potentially also in other
Slavic languages.
