Description:

<strong>Abstract:</strong> This study investigates the perceptions of bank employees towards green finance at ICICI Bank, focusing on how internal stakeholders view and engage with sustainable finance practices. The research aims to evaluate the impact of green finance on environmental sustainability, financial sector resilience, regulatory compliance, market opportunities, and corporate social responsibility. Utilizing a sample of 126 bank employees from two branches, L.B. Nagar and Uppal, the study employs a structured questionnaire and primary data analysis to assess familiarity, knowledge, and attitudes towards green finance. Findings reveal that while a significant portion of employees are familiar with and knowledgeable about green finance, there is a need for further education and increased training participation. Awareness is high regarding renewable energy financing, but low for green bonds and carbon credit trading. Key motivators include financial returns, reputational benefits, and management support, with high implementation costs and regulatory constraints identified as significant barriers. The study provides insights into enhancing ICICI Bank's green finance strategy, emphasizing the need for improved awareness, training, and internal communication.
