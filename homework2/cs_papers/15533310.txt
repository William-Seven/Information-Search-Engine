<span lang="EN-US">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into library services, offering innovative tools for information access and management while raising complex ethical questions. This paper examines ethical AI frameworks &ndash; notably fairness, transparency, and accountability &ndash; as they apply to library systems. We review how AI is currently used in libraries (e.g. recommender systems, automated cataloging, chatbots, and user analytics) and analyze the ethical challenges and risks these applications pose, including data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, and the opacity of AI decision-making. Based on recent literature and guidelines, we reflect on the implications of adopting AI in information access environments, arguing that libraries must align AI deployment with core values such as intellectual freedom, equity of access, and user privacy. Analyzing ten recent scholarly sources, this paper underscores the need for ethical AI strategies in libraries. We conclude that embracing AI&rsquo;s potential in library services requires proactive ethical governance, ongoing assessment, and a commitment to transparency and inclusivity to uphold trust in library institutions.</span>
