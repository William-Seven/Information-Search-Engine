Description:

<em><span>India's tech industry and cryptocurrency market are growing rapidly, creating new opportunities for businesses and investment. But behind all this progress, there is a hidden problem which is organized crime. This study looks at how the Mafia secretly puts its black money into tech startups and cryptocurrency to clean it. They invest in companies, pretending to support innovation, but their real goal is to hide illegal money and make profits without getting caught. The paper explains how the Mafia provides funding to startups in exchange for using them as a way to launder money. They also take advantage of cryptocurrency because it allows them to make secret transactions without being traced. These activities create serious problems, such as unfair competition, a lack of trust among investors, and difficulties for the government in making proper rules. Because technology is growing faster than laws can keep up, criminals find new ways to exploit the system. This study highlights the need for strict monitoring and better rules to stop organized crime from taking over India's digital economy. If proper action is not taken, it could damage the credibility of India's tech industry and create risks for honest businesses and investors.</span></em>
