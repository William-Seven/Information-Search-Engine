<strong>Abstract: </strong>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused remarkable disturbances in the global financial markets, causing a ripple effect in investor behaviour. The Indian stock market has witnessed an investor boom amidst this crisis. This research paper aims to provide a refined understanding of the reasons behind this phenomenon and its profound implications. By focusing on the qualitative research method, such as interviews, questionnaires, and content analysis, this paper delves into the underlying psychological reasons behind the entry of new retail investors into the market during the COVID-19 pandemic. The conclusions spotlight the need to comprehend investor behaviour during times of crisis and highlight how resilient the Indian stock market is in the face of global uncertainty. We&rsquo;ve also inspected factors influencing investor participation, like socio-economic background, risk perception, and access to information. Moreover, we also scrutinise the role of technological advancements, such as online training and trading platforms, in facilitating greater access to the market. The findings of this research paper contribute valuable insights into the underlying psychology behind investor behaviour and the dynamics of the financial market, specifically during times of global crisis. The qualitative perspective in this study adds to various quantitative analyses that offer a nuanced understanding of the human dimensions. In conclusion, this study helps other students, novice and experienced researchers, and market participants devise strategies to enhance market resilience, investor education, and regulatory frameworks amidst unknown challenges.
