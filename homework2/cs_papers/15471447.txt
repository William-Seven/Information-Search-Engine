Description:

I argue on the basis of data from Serbo-Croatian that reciprocity expressions 
combining the equivalents of the words one and other as two separate constituents bear
a non-reciprocal compositional core meaning, as formulated by Vicente&rsquo;s (2010)
and Zimmermann&rsquo;s (2014) work on Spanish, Russian and German data. The
&nbsp;additional components of the two analyses postulated to capture reciprocity &ndash; 
cumulation and type shift, respectively &ndash; are not part of the expression&rsquo;s semantics. Rather,
reciprocity emerges from pragmatics, in the competition of these expressions with
closest competitors whose meanings do not even include reciprocal interpretations
as special cases. Both a syntactic and a semantic analysis is provided.
