<em><span>Education has always been a foundation of human progress and development, serving as a basis for expanding knowledge, enhancing skills, and promoting societal growth. From the earliest days of humanity to the complex education systems of today, the essence of education has remained central to human civilization. However, how education is imparted has evolved drastically and is driven and shaped by cultural, societal, and technological paradigm shifts.</span></em>


<em><span>Since E-education has become the principal mode of learning since the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to support learners and facilitators in digitization. There is a definite need for revolutionary changes in the Indian Education System, which has been thought of and focused on in the latest National Education Policy 2020. Thus, the government has already started trying to provide online access for all learners, and we, as ordinary people, should support such initiatives.</span></em>


<em><span>This paper aims to study and define the process from civilization to rapidly changing educational reforms in today's fast-paced world from an aerial perspective. </span></em>
