Description:

<em>Sonneratia caseolaris</em>, or pedada, is a mangrove species widely distributed across Indonesia with rich ethnobotanical uses and promising phytopharmacological properties. This systematic review aims to consolidate current knowledge on the phytochemical compounds, biological activities, traditional applications, and conservation efforts associated with&nbsp;<em>S. caseolaris</em>. Using PRISMA guidelines, 20 peer-reviewed articles and institutional reports published between 2009 and 2024 were selected. Results indicated that&nbsp;<em>S. caseolaris</em>&nbsp;contains diverse secondary metabolites including flavonoids, phenolics, triterpenoids, tannins, alkaloids, and saponins, many of which exhibit potent antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. Ethnobotanical data reveal its use in traditional medicine, cosmetics, and local food products such as juice, syrup, jam, and dodol. Several community-based conservation and utilization models demonstrate its socio-economic importance. Despite its potential, further research is needed on pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and product development. This review highlights the value of integrating scientific and local knowledge to promote sustainable use and conservation of&nbsp;<em>S. caseolaris</em>.
