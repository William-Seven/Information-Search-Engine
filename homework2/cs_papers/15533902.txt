Description:

<em><span>The integration of smart grid technology has significantly enhanced the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of modern power systems. By incorporating advanced digital communication technologies, Real-time monitoring, automatic control, and the smooth integration of renewable energy sources are made possible by smart grids. These grids rely on interconnected components such as smart meters, sensors, and data analytics platforms to optimize power distribution and consumption. However, this increased digitalization also introduces significant cybersecurity risks, making smart grids a prime target for cyber-attacks.</span></em>


<em><span>Because cyber threats targeting smart grids are constantly changing, traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) like signature-based and rule-based procedures find it difficult to keep up. Attackers are always coming up with new and advanced ways to take advantage of weaknesses in the grid infrastructure, including as malware, phishing and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Furthermore, it is difficult for traditional IDS to efficiently assess and identify threats in real time due to the large volume and diversity of data produced by smart grid components. The dependability of conventional security measures is further diminished by false positives and false negatives, which can result in either excessive warnings or undiscovered breaches.</span></em>


<em><span>Deep learning-based intrusion detection provides a flexible and clever method of protecting smart grids in order to overcome these difficulties. Deep learning models, in contrast to traditional IDS, have the ability to automatically discover patterns in enormous volumes of data, spot irregularities, and find attack vectors that haven't been discovered yet. Convolutional neural networks i.e CNN and long short-term memory i.e LSTM in particular has demonstrated encouraging outcomes in accurately identifying cyber attacks [1]. Deep learning models offer a proactive protection mechanism versus cyber threats in smart grid environments by continuously learning from changing attack patterns.</span></em>


<em><span>This research paper investigates the use of deep learning-based intrusion detection systems for smart grids. A study's main objectives are to analyze real-time smart grid data, train neural network models to identify cyber intrusions, and assess how well they operate in different assault scenarios. By lowering false positives, increasing detection accuracy, and guaranteeing the energy infrastructure's resilience against changing threats, the suggested method seeks to improve cybersecurity in smart grids.
