<em><span>This research paper investigates the phenomenon of rentier capitalism in India, its socio-economic impacts, and the challenges it poses to equitable development. It also examines the adverse effects of rentier capitalism as experienced by developed nations like the United Kingdom and the United States of America, particularly in exacerbating income inequality. Drawing lessons from Singapore and Tokyo's successful policies to counter rentier practices, the paper proposes strategies for India to avoid the pitfalls of rentier capitalism and ensure a more balanced income distribution among its citizens.</span></em>
