Research in this area has led to the creation of a database of diatom species, which enhances the forensic potential of diatoms by providing a reference for identifying species found in forensic samples. The study of diatoms in the Durg rural area of Chhattisgarh not only enriches the existing database but also provides a valuable tool for forensic applications. This research supports the use of diatom analysis in forensic investigations, offering a scientific basis for linking individuals to specific water bodies and aiding in the determination of drowning as a cause of death.
