Description:

This chapter analyses scientific research experiences that show possible contributions of collective, interdisciplinary work in articulation with various sectors of the community for the dissemination of historical knowledge about complex historical processes involving human rights violations. It focuses on developments in recent years concerning the investigation of corporate responsibility in crimes against humanity during the last dictatorship in Argentina (1976-1983) and the Southern Cone and the processes of organisation and repression of workers and the trade union movement, aiming at making visible the impacts of these intersections. In particular, it addresses the possibilities of articulating specialised academic production with different strategies of technological linkage and communication of results to a wider public, with particular attention to artistic formats, addressing their potential and scope.
