<h4>Abstract :</h4>

This study aimed to assess how female fat-tailed sheep respond to diets containing fresh corn stover and corn stover silage enhanced with Fermented Mother Liquor (FML) additives. The experiment involved 15 sheep with an average weight of 18.5 &plusmn; 1.55 kg, using a randomized group design (RAK) comprising three dietary treatments and five groups classified by body weight. The dietary treatments were: 100% fresh corn stover, a 50:50 mix of fresh corn stover and corn stover silage, and 100% corn stover silage. Data analysis was performed using ANOVA, and significant results were further examined with Duncan&rsquo;s Multiple Range Test (DMRT). The findings indicated that none of the treatments had a significant impact on the digestibility of Dry Matter (DMD), Organic Matter (OMD), or Crude Protein (CPD). It was concluded that the diet containing an equal mix of fresh and silage corn stover yielded the most favorable outcomes, although overall digestibility did not differ significantly across treatments. Consequently, corn stover silage with FML additives may serve as a practical alternative to fresh corn stover.
