The review discusses the progressive transformation of enterprise systems through the adoption of advanced digital technologies, particularly cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML). It outlines how these innovations have reshaped traditional enterprise resource planning (ERP) frameworks into intelligent, integrated platforms that support real-time decision-making, automation, and data-driven business strategies. The paper explores how cloud-based infrastructure enhances scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency, enabling organizations to deploy AI and ML capabilities across various operational domains such as finance, supply chain management, customer service, and marketing. Special attention is given to the integration of AI for predictive analytics, pattern recognition, and personalized services that optimize enterprise performance. The review further examines challenges related to system interoperability, data security, migration complexity, and the ongoing need for technical expertise. Through the analysis of recent case studies and implementation models, the paper highlights practical outcomes including increased efficiency, reduced operational costs, and improved strategic responsiveness. Ultimately, the review positions cloud-enabled AI as a critical driver in the evolution of modern enterprise systems, supporting long-term competitiveness and sustainable digital transformation.
