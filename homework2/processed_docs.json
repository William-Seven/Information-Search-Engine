    "raw_description": "Individual animals differ in their responses to environmental challenges. Identifying these differences before animals are translocated could be a useful tool in improving postrelease success. For most species, however, uncertainty persists around which behaviours contribute to postrelease success. Greater bilbies, <em>Macrotis lagotis</em>, are a threatened species, for which detailed behavioural studies in situ are rare. We tested bilbies prior to their release to a fenced safe haven to examine whether (1) bilby response to a known threat (that is, human observer) and novelty (that is, novel scent) was individually different and repeatable, or alternatively plastic, and (2) if any behaviours were related to bilby fitness (breeding success and survival) postrelease. We found that several behaviours measured during trapping (exposure to a known threat) were individually variable and repeatable and that males that were less responsive (lower respiratory rate) during handling had greater breeding success (that is, the number of offspring sired relative to the opportunity to breed). Contrastingly, individual differences in bilby response to novel scents were not repeatable, but we did, however, find sex-specific responses in this context. Males took less time to initiate touch with the novel-scented object and touched the object more times than females, suggesting that males are less neophobic. Plasticity rather than personality predicted female post-release fitness. Females that were increasingly cautious of novelty had greater relative breeding success. Our study is the first to confirm repeatable and plastic behaviours in bilbies, develop a standardized test for prerelease screening of behaviours, and examine the fitness consequences of these behaviours. We encourage the use of the 'trap test' as a simple and practical way to screen bilbies for future conservation translocations. We also recommend further testing in environments where the risk of establishment failure may be higher (that is, invasive predators present) and where the fitness consequences may be more profound and thus detectable.\n\n\nContents:\n - R_code.zip",

    "raw_description": "<div>\n\nTsova-Tush is an East Caucasian language spoken in one single village in Eastern Georgia by approximately 300 speakers. Since its early description, scholars have been intrigued by the high degree of linguistic influence from the Georgian language. This book has a threefold goal: (1) To contribute to the overall description of the Tsova-Tush language, by filling gaps in the previous literature in absence of a reference grammar. (2) To contrast Tsova-Tush constructions with functionally equivalent constructions in Chechen and Ingush, its closest relatives, and with Georgian, the language of wider communication which all Tsova-Tush speakers speak as a second language, in order to form hypotheses concerning which Tsova-Tush construction is inherited, and which has arisen under influence of Georgian. (3) To provide the most probable diachronic scenario of language contact, by looking at historical Tsova-Tush language data, as well as at its historical sociolinguistics.\n\n\n\nThis book provides a basic description of Tsova-Tush, in particular in the domain of spatial cases (which exhibit a two-slot system similar to Daghestanian languages), TAME categories (indentifying a Iamitive and a Past Subjunctive developing indirect evidential semantics), complex verbs, and subordination and clause-chaining (which in Tsova-Tush is finite).\n\n\n\nIn terms of language contact, this book concludes that (1) Tsova-Tush conforms to most established borrowing hierarchies and theories surrounding intensity of contact, except for the borrowing of a verbal inflection marker in a remarkably early stage of contact; (2) The Georgian influence that Tsova-Tush shows in sources from the 1850 suggest that a notable increase in bilingualism occured already at a point where there was little institutional or numeral dominance of surrounding the Georgian-language population. A change in ethnic self-identification can be the underlying factor for the early instances of contact-induced change.\n\n</div>\n\nContents:\n - 459-WichersSchreur-2025.pdf",

The article is not meant to be an academic biography -- it is a `workshop visit'. The reader will be guided through the scientific development of the Structural Grammar Research Group established at the linguistic department of the German Academy of Sciences (East Berlin) at the end of the 1950s, which Ilse Zimmermann joined in the mid-1960s.\n\n\nThe Structural Grammar Research Group (Arbeitsstelle Strukturelle Grammatik,\nASG) was at its beginning strongly influenced by Roman Jakobson&rsquo;s structuralism,\nand later adopted Chomsky&rsquo;s generative grammar. One outstanding result of the\nearly period was the insight that the basic position of the German verb is \nsentence-final. This raised questions about the difference between verbs and nouns, more\nprecisely, nominalizations, which then became the focus of Ilse Zimmermann&rsquo;s\nwork. A structure of lexical entities was suggested that takes into account the\n&nbsp;parallels between sentences and nominalizations including semantic features referring\nto basic cognitive properties while showing the asymmetry characteristics known\nfrom structuralism.\n\n\n\nWhile the ASG&rsquo;s research attracted increasing attention in the linguistic field, the\nsituation in the Academy became politically tight, eventually leading to the \nliquidation of the group in the beginning of the 1970s. It was re-established ten years later\nunder the label of cognitive linguistics, with Ilse Zimmermann back on board. The\nfocus of the second group was on dimensional adjectives and included syntactic,\nsemantic and also cognitive aspects. Open questions from the earlier period were\nrevisited and considered from a more general point of view.\n\n\n\nAfter the fall of the Wall the group was finally transformed into a Max Planck\nresearch group where its research agenda finally came to an end, or rather, was\ntaken up in various other linguistic projects, from different perspectives.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nContents:\n - 453-Zimmermann-2025-12.pdf",

The goal of my contribution is to complete and systematize empirical facts as well as probe ways to explain the cross-linguistic distribution of the construction. The typological distinction between SVO and SOV languages might play a role. On the other hand, the linguistic facts that are presented in this chapter suggest that an areal factor plays a crucial role.

Consequently, the semantic representations must\ndisplay a higher degree of granularity than Davidson (1967b) suggested for action\nverbs. Adverbials may be anchored to variables that refer to cause, effect, or state.\nA dilemma emerges: Semantic integration of an adverbial modifier requires that\nthe relevant variable be bound by a &lambda;-operator (cf. Higginbotham 1985, Bierwisch\n1988, von Stechow 2012). Only the highest-ranked referential argument variable\ncan be &lambda;-bound at the point of determining reference. I will offer a solution that is\nbased on the modification template as originally proposed by Zimmermann (1992).\nThe template, however, needs to be refined in order for technical implementation\nto work and, thus, cover the entire range of cases. The empirical data discussed in\nthe present chapter come from the Slavic languages.\n\n\nContents:\n - 453-Zimmermann-2025-16.pdf",

The sand tested is typically used in Great Britain for&nbsp;\nsanding wheel-rail contacts and is named GB sand here. &nbsp;\nThe sand is filled in and normal stresses of 300MPa, 600MPa and 900MPa are applied,&nbsp;\nwhich corresponds to vertical forces of 5.89kN, 11.78kN, 17.67kN.&nbsp;\nThe sand grains crush under the applied stresses and sand fragments solidify under such high stresses to a tablet like specimen of about 4mm height.&nbsp;\nThe test rig in vertical direction operates force controlled.&nbsp;\nThe measured vertical force, which is used by the controller, shows a dependency from the shear forces.&nbsp;\nThis undesired behaviour is thought to be caused by the placement of the used strain gauges.&nbsp;\nThus, the results presented here should be seen as indication, an error of up to 20% in the vertical force is possible.\nAfter the normal stress is applied, the shearing of the specimen starts (position controlled).&nbsp;\n\n\nThe measurement data is contained in csv files and file names contain the applied stress and a number of the test, e.g.&nbsp;\nGBsand_shear_300MPa_1.csv is conducted under 300MPa and is test no 1.&nbsp;\nFor each level of applied stress three measurements are conducted resulting in nine data files.&nbsp;\n\n\nEach file consists of 7 columns:\ncolumn 1: vertical displacement of top plate [mm]\ncolumn 2: vertical (normal) force measured on top plate [kN]\ncolumn 3: vertical displacement of bottom plate [mm]\ncolumn 4: vertical (normal) force measured on bottom plate [kN]\ncolumn 5: shear displacement [mm]\ncolumn 6: shear force [kN]\n\n\nPlease see the referenced paper for further details on the conducted experiments.\n\n\nContents:\n - ShearTestData.zip\n - Readme.txt",

Each student takes the role of an astronomer running a survey of the sky. They are given a science goal and must balance their goal with the needs of the community to observe a wide range of objects.\n\n\nThe game is intended for anyone from high school &amp; above and can be played in groups of 2-4 players. Once the players have familiarized themselves with the rules a game typically takes less than 30 minutes. It&rsquo;s obviously not a completely faithful representation of what happens when astronomers are making decisions on what objects to observe, but it gives students who play the game a good introduction to some of the factors that astronomers need to take into account, and hopefully it&rsquo;s fun too.\n\n\nYou can print your own copies of the game using the attached files. These are provided in two different paper sizes, A4 for most countries and letter format for the US and Canada; and in two different formats (Powerpoint and PDF). When printing select double sided printing flipped on the short edge. Feel free to print as many copies as you like, share it, translate it or adapt it for your needs.

This report focuses on the two challenging and interdependent dimensions: technical interoperability (concerning data exchange mechanisms, protocols, and system integration) and semantic interoperability (concerning shared understanding of data through vocabularies, ontologies, and metadata).</span>\n\n\n<span lang=\"EN-US\">The deliverable synthesises findings from various sources, including EOSC task force outputs<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><sup><span><span lang=\"EN-US\">[1]</span></span></sup></a>, contributions from FAIR-IMPACT work packages (WP3 - PID, WP4 - Metadata and ontologies and WP5 - FAIR Assessment), and evaluation of core EOSC components such as the Metadata Schema and Crosswalk Registry (MSCR), PID Graph, Data Type Registry (DTR), and Compliance Assessment Toolkit (CAT). It analyses the use of these tools in seven representative cross-domain projects&mdash;AquaInfra, Blue-Cloud, EOSC4CANCER, FAIR-EASE, EOSC Future, SciLake, and WorldFAIR&mdash;highlighting real-world interoperability challenges and solutions.</span>\n\n\n<span lang=\"EN-US\">Key observations include the ubiquitous need for metadata harmonisation, the importance of crosswalks and mappings, the underutilisation of certain EOSC tools, and the potential of AI-assisted methods for metadata alignment. In response, the deliverable introduces a set of practical metrics and checklists that align with the EOSC Interoperability Framework (EOSC IF) and Cross-Domain Interoperability Framework (CDIF), supporting both assessment and implementation.</span>\n\n\n<span lang=\"EN-US\">Overall, this deliverable provides a comprehensive guide for improving interoperability across disciplines, enabling more effective data sharing and reuse within EOSC.

    "raw_description": "<span lang=\"EN-US\">This study explores functional analogies between hierarchical reference systems in the human neocortex and those emerging within modern Large Language Models (LLMs). It posits that, through exposure to extensive linguistic data, artificial neural networks can give rise to emergent capabilities that are functionally analogous to those of specialized cortical areas, despite being grounded in fundamentally different architectures. Drawing inspiration from the work of Hawkins et al. on neocortical grid cells, the study applies their core conceptual principles to hypothesize that similar structural principles may manifest within LLMs during training and inference. We demonstrate that, when exposed to multimodal inputs, these models acquire the capacity to operate across nested reference systems, effectively mirroring core computational functions of the neocortex. Using a cross-domain translation methodology, we explore how such internal systems support the processing of structurally complex information across multiple cognitive domains&mdash;including language, vision, and music. A multimodal case study illustrates how proportional and hierarchical relationships can be maintained across representational formats, offering empirical evidence for the emergence of generalized internal representations. The findings suggest a functional convergence between biological and artificial systems, pointing toward universal computational principles that transcend the constraints of their respective substrates. While preliminary, this work proposes that the emergent dynamics of artificial neural networks may reflect domain-general mechanisms of abstraction and representation, resonating with both cognitive and neural theories of intelligence, and with potentially valuable implications across a range of practical and interdisciplinary fields.</span>\n\n\nContents:\n - neuroai_cognitive_patterns_2025.pdf",

Computer simulations provide a complementary approach, enabling the study of complex systems, i.e. systems driven by local interactions rather than a central authority.\n\n\nLanguage is such a self-organising system, shaped by countless local interactions. Simulations allow us to test theoretical questions, such as Bybee&rsquo;s theory of reduction, which links frequency of use to phonetic erosion. We use Python to model language users with memories of vectorised words. Communication occurs through vector comparisons, with reduction simulated as an attentuation of vector values. Our results show that cooperation between speakers and hearers is imperative for communication to remain successful under reduction.\n\n\nOur approach demonstrates how simulations pushes theoretical boundaries in the digital humanities. While not a substitute for empirical research, simulations extend our capacity to test hypotheses, refine theories, and deepen our understanding of complex systems.\n\n\nContents:\n - Sevenants2025_DHB2025.pdf",

To overcome this scenario, scientific dissemination has gradually emerged as a movement for transmitting scientific knowledge in a unidirectional and vertical model, in which the scientist assumes the role of sender and the general public that of receiver. More recently, however, scientific dissemination has progressed toward a dialogical and participatory approach &ndash; namely, a bidirectional and horizontal model. The field of Linguistics, however, still faces challenges due to its historical constitution as a science marked by the distancing of those considered laypersons. In this context, UNESCO World Atlas of Languages emerges as an instrument for the popularization of linguistic knowledge, promoting awareness of linguistic diversity and the participation of a previously overlooked public. Thus, this article aims to discuss UNESCO World Atlas of Languages as a tool for the popularization of Linguistics, specifically regarding its methodology of collaborative production between researchers and the non-linguist public &ndash; a public that often consists of speakers of marginalized languages under the monolingual conception established and reinforced in Brazil.</span>\n\n\n<span lang=\"EN\">KEYWORDS<strong>: </strong></span><span lang=\"EN\">Scientific Dissemination; Linguistics Popularization; UNESCO Atlas; Linguistic Diversity.</span>\n\n\nContents:\n - 5 The Atlas - TRAD.edit.pdf",

To this end, in addition to recovering studies on teaching, scientific dissemination and scientific popularization, we analyzed, supported by the categories of Semantics of Action (Machado; Bronckart, 2009), the responses &ndash; generated from a questionnaire on Google Forms &ndash; of thirty (30) Portuguese Language teachers working in Basic Education, who collaborated with Sousa's research (2025). The results point to Teaching as a path that, in dialogue with scientific dissemination, can favor society's access to/use of scientific knowledge, from the perspective of scientific popularization. Regarding the place of Linguistics in school, teachers are aware of the importance and need to disseminate/popularize Linguistics knowledge in Portuguese classes, as well as there is a demand from these teachers for access to scientific linguistic knowledge, in addition to the fact that there are already actions by research groups and institutions to include Linguistics in schools and to train teachers in this perspective.

We compare the performance of the Hull-White model with other short-rate models, namely the Vasicek and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) models, in pricing callable bonds across various market conditions. We demonstrate through extensive numerical simulations and empirical analysis that the Hull-White model generally outperforms other models in fitting the initial term structure and pricing callable bonds, particularly in volatile interest rate environments. We also propose an improved parameter estimation method for the Hull-White model, which enhances its pricing accuracy. Furthermore, we explore the implications of using the Hull-White model for callable bond pricing on issuer and investor behavior. Our findings contribute to the literature on interest rate modelling and provide practical guidelines for financial professionals in callable bonds' valuation and risk management.\n\n\nContents:\n - A260105010525.pdf",

    "raw_description": "<strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper explores the transformative integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into business administration, particularly within economics and finance. Through an extensive review, the research investigates what impact AI has across core business domains such as human resources, finance, marketing, and logistics, and how AI technologies&mdash;automation, data analytics, and machine learning&mdash;redefine traditional administrative practices. The study identifies AI&rsquo;s role in optimizing routine operations, enhancing cost-efficiency, and improving customer experiences by leveraging large datasets for actionable insights. The research delves into why these impacts are significant by examining AI-driven enhancements in human resources (recruitment, talent management, and engagement), finance (predictive analytics, risk management, and fraud detection), marketing (personalization and predictive engagement), and logistics (route optimization, demand forecasting, and inventory management). This analysis provides insights into how AI-driven efficiencies and innovative strategies contribute to strategic decision-making and organizational competitiveness. Addressing why AI integration also presents challenges, the study highlights ethical concerns like job displacement, algorithmic bias, and data privacy, urging responsible AI practices that uphold transparency, fairness, and accountability. The research underscores the necessity for AI education, ethical frameworks, and ongoing innovation to harness AI&rsquo;s potential while mitigating associated risks fully. In conclusion, this paper emphasizes that the future of business administration will likely involve a synergistic approach, where AI complements human intelligence. The findings suggest that AI holds vast potential for shaping sustainable business models, advanced decision-making, and enhanced economic practices, ultimately contributing to an AI-enabled future in business administration.\n\n\nContents:\n - A260205010525.pdf",

    "raw_description": "<strong>Abstract:</strong> Risk and uncertainty are inextricable components of life. Although it is difficult to move away from it, one can minimize the impact of risk and uncertainty through insurance. One of these is life insurance, which directly connects to our lives. Thus, the provision of life insurance, according to the rules and regulations established by the government, necessitates the co-existence of public and private life insurance companies in our economy. Life Insurance is a growing domain, as many of our population is not covered yet. In the event of mis-happenings, it offers financial security to a family and supports economic growth from many perspectives. However, given specific barriers from individual and social attitudes and regulatory norms, life insurance companies have not grown in our country as they should have. As a result, bearing in mind the significance of life insurance to an individual and the economy, the current study has been undertaken to analyse the roles, importance, and impact of life insurance through life insurance companies on our economy. Thus, HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited has been taken as a case study unit, keeping in mind the functions, features and business planning followed to grow.\n\n\nContents:\n - A260905010525.pdf",

    "raw_description": "<strong>Abstract: </strong>The Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) is a comprehensive Basel III framework introduced to overhaul market risk capital requirements during the 2007&ndash;2009 financial crisis. The framework includes two main approaches for measuring market risk capital: a more risk-sensitive Internal Models Approach (IMA) for banks that obtain supervisory approval and a revised Standardised Approach (SA) that applies granular risk-weighted sensitivities for all banks. This framework has global significance, and its implementation is underway across major jurisdictions. However, the United States, European Union and United Kingdom have taken somewhat divergent paths and timelines in adopting FRTB, reflecting local regulatory priorities and constraints. This document provides a condensed analysis of FRTB&rsquo;s framework, comparing US, UK and EU regulatory approaches, methodologies, and model approval processes. It also discusses the anticipated impact on large international banks, including changes in risk-weighted assets and capital requirements. It evaluates whether FRTB&rsquo;s benefits in risk management and financial stability justify the compliance costs. The findings underscore FRTB&rsquo;s role in strengthening market risk regulation while highlighting the importance of coordinated implementation and fine-tuning to address industry concerns. Key innovations of FRTB include: desk-level model approvals, a rigorous Profit &amp; Loss Attribution (PLAT) test to ensure model accuracy, a Default Risk Charge (DRC) for jump-to-default risks and capital add-ons for Non-Modellable Risk Factors (NMRFs). Since BCBS finalized FRTB standards (as part of the Basel III &ldquo;final reforms&rdquo; in 2017&ndash;2019) [5], jurisdictions have moved at different paces to implement them.\n\n\nContents:\n - A261005010525.pdf",

Financial literacy is essential for effective personal finance management, enabling informed savings, investments, and debt decisions. This review assesses current levels of financial literacy among women across different regions and socio-economic contexts, identifies influential factors, and evaluates interventions aimed at improving women's financial literacy. The study includes a comprehensive search of databases such as Scopus, Elsevier, and Google Scholar, using predefined criteria to select relevant papers. Extracted data from the selected studies reveal significant disparities in financial literacy between men and women, with women generally scoring lower. Factors contributing to these disparities include socioeconomic status, educational attainment, cultural norms, and access to financial education. Studies indicate that women often have lower confidence and engagement in financial decision-making. The review emphasises the need for tailored financial education programs addressing the specific needs of diverse groups of women. Policy interventions that integrate financial education into school curricula and community programs are recommended to promote early and lifelong financial skills. The rise of digital financial services offers new opportunities for enhancing financial inclusion and literacy among women. Enhancing women's financial literacy is crucial for their economic, social, and psychological empowerment, contributing to broader socioeconomic development and gender equality.\n\n\nContents:\n - A261605010525.pdf",

    "raw_description": "<strong>Abstract:</strong> In the Indian federal system, the Central Finance Commission is appointed every five years under Article 280 to make recommendations on the distribution of central taxes among the states. Besides, the central government provides grants for various needs to the states under Article 275. To address challenges such as evident economic imbalances, distorted resource distribution, natural disasters, epidemics, and adverse global events, the Government of India has established a robust and resilient grant system. Unlike the central share of taxes, the central government imposes selected conditions on utilising specific grants. Some states have complained that this affects their fiscal autonomy. However, in many states, by sacrificing the basic tenets of public resource utilisation, stupendous amounts of loans are mobilised in the name of capital investment and diverted to financial extravagance for their political gain, creating fiscal stress in the economy and a high burden for the taxpayers in the years to come. In this context, the role of central grants in the financial status and economy of various states is analysed with the help of simple statistical techniques using budget data. This system is designed to deliver assistance rapidly during crises, supported by a flexible framework that helps states navigate their crisis phases efficiently. At the same time, federal grants are beneficial for achieving sustainable development goals. They encourage states to prioritise projects that emphasise environmental and social considerations and maximise creative and productive investments. The advantages of grants from the central government extend beyond mere financial assistance; they also strengthen the country&rsquo;s framework and improve public welfare programs that promote inclusive development for all. Further, these grants empower states and help them fully leverage the benefits of a cooperative federal structure. This article analyses the goals of central grants, focusing on practicality and effectiveness.\n\n\nContents:\n - A262305010525.pdf",

Smallholder taxpayers face challenges in adopting and effectively using EFDs. This study examined the influence of individual factors on the usage of EFDS among smallholder taxpayers in Moshi Municipality, Tanzania. The study was grounded in Technology Acceptance Theory by Davis (1989). The study adopted a concurrent design using a mixed-methods approach. A sample size of 368 was obtained through a sample size calculator. Respondents were sampled through simple random sampling and purposive sampling. Data were collected using questionnaires and interview guides. The study used content validity to validate the research instruments, and reliability was assessed by using SPSS, where Likert scale questionnaire items were subjected to Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha analysis and obtained a coefficient of 0.86, indicating good reliability. Statistical Package for Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyse quantitative data through descriptive statistics, while qualitative data were analyzed through contextual analysis. Ethical considerations for conducting research were observed throughout the process. The study found that individual factors influenced the usage of EFD among smallholder taxpayers in Moshi Municipality. Based on the study's findings, it was concluded that individual factors influenced the usage of EFDs among smallholder taxpayers in Moshi Municipality. Further, it was concluded that government policy and regulation were highly influenced by the use of electronic fiscal devices (EFDs). The study also recommended that the government prioritize initiatives to increase awareness and education about EFDs among smallholder taxpayers in Moshi Municipality. It is also recommended that the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) in the Kilimanjaro Region should develop awareness campaigns and educational materials for smallholder taxpayers. Smallholder taxpayers were advised to prioritise training and capacity building for their employees.

Governments and tax authorities face new issues due to tax evasion, fraud, tax avoidance, and insufficient tax discipline. Additionally, there is a growing need for better justice and transparency in taxation. It necessitates the development of effective and innovative methods for collecting VAT. The current study was conducted in Moshi Municipality to assess the effects of taxpayers' morale on VAT collection. The study was based on the Theory of Collection Efficiency of Value Added Tax. The study population consisted of 687 taxpayers registered for VAT in the study area. A sample of 158 individuals was selected using the Yamane formula (1964). Data was collected using a questionnaire. Face-to-face and content validity were used to verify content validity. A Cronbach's alpha coefficient test was used for reliability, where a 0.822 coefficient level was obtained. A Logistic Regression model was used to analyse data, while descriptive statistics were used to organise data. The study's findings show that taxpayers' VAT tax morale in the study area decreases with age. Additionally, the educational background of the household is strongly associated with taxpayers' tax morale. Furthermore, household affluence hurts VAT compliance among taxpayers. On the other hand, the attendance of VAT Programmes has a significant positive effect on tax morale and collection. It is concluded that various elements, including individual variables, contextual variables, and other aspects, contribute to tax morale among taxpayers. It is recommended that governments, tax authorities, and educational program designers disseminate information and provide education to both existing and future taxpayers. It will help enhance the tax culture in the study region and, ultimately, in Tanzania.\n\n\nContents:\n - B259604021124.pdf",

This study examines the influence of technology adoption on the operational performance of medium commercial banks in Moshi Municipality in Tanzania, including Mkombozi Bank, Uchumi Commercial Bank, and Akiba Commercial Bank. A concurrent research design with a mixed methods approach was used, where the qualitative and quantitative data were collected. The population of the study was 63 employees of the three banks, and the sample size was determined through the census technique as the population size was small. Primary data was collected from the respondents, while secondary data was collected from the 2019/20 to 2022/2023 annual report. Face-to-face and content validity were used for the instrument's validity, while reliability was established through a test-retest process. As for data analysis, descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analysis were done to test the influence of technology adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic on the operational efficiency of commercial banks in the study area. The study's findings have shown that debit cards, credit cards, mobile banking, and Point of Sale (POS) positively influence the net profit margin at p-values less than 0.05. In contrast, credit and debit cards negatively influence the operational efficiency of the studied banks. The study concludes that debit cards, credit cards, internet banking, mobile banking, and POS positively impact the net profit margin. Similarly, debit cards and credit cards negatively influence the operating expenses ratio. It is recommended that banks take advantage of these technologies to expand their net profit margins while being careful with debit cards and credit cards, regarding the operational efficiency of the banks.\n\n\nContents:\n - B259704021124.pdf",

A mixedmethods research approach was employed, combining interviews, questionnaires, and documentary reviews. Key stakeholders, including students and finance officers, were engaged to gather comprehensive data. This approach facilitated a detailed analysis of how e-banking systems contribute to revenue collection in the context of higher education. A pilot study involved a selected sample subset and was crucial for identifying potential issues with the survey questionnaire and interview protocols. Notably, the reliability of the data collected during the pilot phase was rigorously assessed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient test, a statistical measure of internal consistency. The results were promising, with a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.704, indicating a good level of reliability, affirming the instruments' ability to measure the variables of interest consistently. Data Analysis involved both descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings indicated high satisfaction with the system&rsquo;s reliability, particularly its capability to handle high transaction volumes during peak periods and its robust security measures safeguarding user transactions, contributing to revenue collection significantly at p-value &lt; 0.05. The study concluded that the e-banking system's reliability is crucial in optimising revenue collection processes. It is recommended that regular updates, an enhanced user interface based on feedback, expanded technical support, and continuous improvement in security measures be implemented to maintain and improve system efficiency.\n\n\nContents:\n - B259904021124.pdf",

    "raw_description": "<em><span lang=\"EN-IN\">Depression is a very common mental health problem that highly influences people's quality of life and poses significant challenges to clinical diagnosis. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which show the brain's electrical activity, have emerged as an important tool for detecting depression. This paper proposes a novel hybrid model that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to effectively classify depression from EEG signals. The LSTM component of the model is particularly good at retaining temporal relationships within EEG data, handling long sequences and identifying important features associated with depressive states. The SNN component, which models the spiking dynamics of biological neurons, also improves the model's capacity for handling the spatiotemporal patterns present in EEG signals and offering a more biologically plausible way of representing the data. Through the amalgamation of the strengths of the LSTM and SNN architectures, the hybrid model obtains a more stable and accurate classification of depression. The experimental method employed here is the use of the synaptic time-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule in a 3-dimensional brain-template organized SNN model. Experimental results show that the model proposed in this paper outperforms classical machine learning algorithms and single architecture-based models in sensitivity, specificity, and classification accuracy. The approach has excellent classification accuracy with average performance rates at 98%. This far surpasses other top deep learning methods. This method represents a significant leap forward in automated depression detection with EEG signals, with potential real-time clinical utility and personalized treatment planning.</span></em>\n\n\nContents:\n - EEG-Based Depression Detection -Formatted Paper.pdf",

    "raw_description": "<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper investigates the relationship between economic growth and employment in India, focusing on the postreform period. Using a semi-log quadratic model, the study examines trends in GDP and jobs, drawing comparisons across various countries and income groups. The Granger causality test and the Johansen co-integration technique are employed to analyse the linkages between these variables. The findings reveal that while GDP and employment exhibit positive correlations in some countries, including China, Pakistan, and the USA, the relationship is predominantly negative in India, where corresponding increases in employment have not accompanied GDP growth. Specifically, the study finds that a 1% increase in GDP leads to a 0.28% reduction in employment. The results underscore the \"jobless growth\" phenomenon in India, where structural shifts towards capital-intensive sectors have led to stagnation in labour absorption. This paper argues that economic growth in India must be redefined to focus on output expansion and inclusive job creation. The paper concludes with policy recommendations aimed at fostering labour-intensive growth, promoting skill development, and addressing regional disparities, to ensure that economic growth translates into equitable employment opportunities for all sectors of society.\n\n\nContents:\n - C2508051322.pdf",

By synthesizing findings from a diverse array of research studies, the review highlights the multifaceted nature of wood waste valorization, emphasizing the critical role of sorting and separation technologies in ensuring high-quality recovery of materials.  It also identifies the wood classification practices in Europe, which are crucial for creating a harmonized valorization framework that aligns technological advancements with regulatory standards. The analysis reveals that integrating these components—technologies, sorting methods, and classification practices can significantly improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of wood waste management. Furthermore, the review identifies existing gaps in research and practice, providing actionable recommendations for stakeholders aiming to optimize wood valorization waste systems. These recommendations emphasize the necessity for a holistic approach and a clearly defined, comprehensive framework for wood valorization that considers all elements involved in the process. By addressing these areas, the review not only aims to contribute to the body of knowledge in wood waste valorization but also seeks to promote sustainable practices that benefit both the environment and the economy, paving the way for a more circular approach to wood resource utilization.\n\nThis systematic literature review examines various approaches to wood waste valorization and classification, with the aim of evaluating their effectiveness in promoting sustainable wood resource management and increasing the economic value of wood waste. The review focuses on technologies for valorizing wood waste from construction, demolition, and furniture, with attention to treatment methods, key technologies like sorting and separation, and best practices, while also identifying challenges, opportunities, and research gaps that could support sustainable wood resource management and a circular economy.\n\nA Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach was employed to comprehensively assess valorization technologies for wood waste derived from construction, demolition, and furniture waste, following the methodology outlined by \n                    Harris \n                        et al.

The review addresses the research question: What wood valorization technologies (for both pure and mixed treatment) are currently available, and what criteria should be considered when selecting a valorization route? To answer this question, contextual keywords were carefully analyzed and structured into a search query with three levels. A search string was developed using Boolean operators, and filters were applied based on article types and inclusion criteria. A total of 152 papers were identified from searches conducted in Science Direct and Scopus, following the PRISMA review technique to ensure transparency and repeatability.\n\nThe findings highlight the current state of research in wood valorization and classification, revealing significant gaps in the comprehensive exploration of technologies, sorting methods, and classification frameworks. The need for further development in integrating classification and valorization strategies to achieve sustainable wood management is emphasized. The strength of evidence is high, as despite the challenges posed by the limited number of scholarly papers, valuable and relevant insights were successfully drawn from the available literature. The refined search query navigated these constraints by effectively balancing specificity and breadth, revealing critical gaps in the field and providing a robust foundation for understanding current knowledge.

Studies were included if they were randomized or non-randomized controlled trials, prospective or retrospective cohort studies reporting longitudinal body weight measurements of adults who smoked cigarettes and either partially or entirely substituted ENDS for smoking. Quality assessment was performed using the JBI quality assessment tools, and bias was reported using the Oxford Catalogue of Bias. The GRADE approach was used to evaluate the certainty of the evidence.\n\n\n<strong>Results:&nbsp;</strong>The systematic review included nine articles from eight trials. Study designs were five RCTs, two cohort studies, and one quasi-experimental study. Two studies had a high risk of bias, five had some concerns, and one was at low risk. Weight change varied, with a consistent pattern of weight gain over time for exclusive ENDS users and modest weight gain for dual users. The overall body of evidence was considered weak because the total number of participants was less than 1000.\n\n\n<strong>Conclusions:&nbsp;</strong>ENDS use may have a modest impact on weight status among individuals trying to quit smoking.

Retinal detachment is a disorder of the eye. It is described as a critical condition in which all retinal layers are pulled away from their normal position. Retinal detachment can lead to visual impairment or loss of vision. So, diagnosing retinal detachment disease at an earlier stage is very important. This study aims to analyse the position of retinal detachment from the retina's blood vessels. The process of extracting the normal and detached retinal position is conducted by the Four Steps: image pre-processing, applying a Filter, multi-thresholding with image binarisation, extracting the retinal blood vessels, and extracting the position of Retinal detachment disease. In this research, we used the local dataset of Aravid_eye_care hospital from the IEEE website, which contains the retinal detachment fundus image. In this work, we extract one feature of Retinal Detachment disease, i.e., the Retina's blood vessels. Also, we compare the healthy retina and the detached position of the retina from the blood vessels.\n\n\nContents:\n - C106405030325.pdf",

This technology has transformed the pharmaceutical industry by enabling miniaturised, highthroughput, and economical drug discovery, formulation, and delivery solutions. Creating sophisticated drug delivery systems like nanoparticles and liposomes has become far simpler because this method can precisely control fluid dynamics, enabling faster reaction kinetics and better drug encapsulation. Beyond drug formulation, microfluidic platforms enable disease modelling, toxicity assessment, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis, providing a quick and efficient alternative to conventional techniques. In addition, devices like microfluidic chips combine several analysis processes into a single device with less reagent consumption and enhanced research encouragement. Furthermore, microfluidics is vital in personalised medicine and point-of-care diagnostics, offering rapid, more accurate testing for a customised treatment strategy. The increased use of microfluidics in pharmaceutical research is promising to facilitate faster drug discovery, enhance individualised medicine, and improve point-of-care diagnostic testing.

To study their respiratory health effects, there is the issue of heterogenous patterns of use: concurrently with cigarette smoking (dual use), exclusive use after smoking cessation (exclusive use), or use initiated without any prior or current use of cigarettes (na&iuml;ve use). Our primary goal was to synthesize the evidence on the respiratory effects of ECs use in adults, categorized by their pattern of use. Additionally, we identified the highest quality systematic reviews and critically evaluated the current literature on this topic. The review was developed with published umbrella review guidelines. The database searches were Medline, Scopus, Cochrane, Epistemonikos, LILACS, and grey literature databases. The criterion for inclusion of systematic reviews was analyses of respiratory tests from randomized controlled trials or cohort studies. Quality assessments were performed with AMSTAR2 and a checklist of reporting biases. A narrative analysis was synthesized by test method: spirometry, impulse oscillometry, breath gasses, biomarkers, and clinical serious adverse events. Twelve systematic reviews were included. The findings on respiratory functioning were statistically non-significant across all patterns of use. Reporting bias was frequently observed. Based on the current research, there is no evidence of significant change in the short or medium term in respiratory function with any pattern of ECs use. We attribute the null findings to the weaknesses of acute studies, the participants&rsquo; smoking history masking testing, and the inclusion of participants with a low frequency of use.</span>\n\n\nContents:\n - la-rosa-et-al-2025-patterns-of-use-of-e-cigarettes-and-their-respiratory-effects-a-critical-umbrella-review.pdf",

Individuals belonging to all age groups, occupations, communities, and socio-economic backgrounds need to augment information regarding various factors that promote good health and well-being, both physically and psychologically. All types of factors are required to be put into operation in a well-organised and regimented manner. In other words, positivity needs to be reinforced in all the factors. It is understood that leading to the up-gradation of overall living conditions is regarded as one of the primary goals for individuals, belonging to all communities and socio-economic backgrounds. To achieve this goal, one must consider several factors, i.e. education, careers, employment opportunities, resources, assets, property, health, well-being, family, relationships, personality traits and overall living conditions. All factors must be implemented adequately, so one will be physically and psychologically healthy. Hence, to carry out all tasks and activities in a successful manner, one may not be free from health problems and illnesses, but one needs to be psychologically sound. Therefore, it is well understood that promoting good health and well-being is essential to improving living conditions.

Other people who formerly smoked cigarettes are completely substituting ENDS (exclusive use). A small number of people who have never smoked cigarettes are using ENDS (na&iuml;ve use of nicotine). Each of these patterns of use results in different exposures to toxins. Unfortunately, epidemiological studies routinely group together any ENDS use regardless of other tobacco use.\n\n\n<span>Objective:</span>This umbrella review primarily aims to present all the evidence available on the respiratory effects of ENDS use by adults based on their pattern of use: dual use, exclusive use, and na&iuml;ve use. With each of these patterns of use, are there benefits, no changes, or harmful effects on respiratory functioning? Our objective is to provide clinicians with a detailed analysis of how different patterns of ENDS use impact respiratory functioning and to point to the best sources of evidence.\n\n\n<span>Methods:</span>This umbrella review follows the Methods for Overviews of Reviews framework and the PRIOR (Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews) statement. Systematic reviews published since 2019 will be searched across 4 databases and 3 gray literature sources. Additional searches will include citation chasing, references lists, and referrals from respiratory specialists. The quality of included reviews will be evaluated using the AMSTAR2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) checklist. We will document biases in 3 areas: protocol deviations, biases from the Oxford Catalogue of Bias, and internal data discrepancies. Two reviewers will independently conduct the search and quality assessments. Our analysis will focus on reviews rated as moderate or high confidence by AMSTAR2. We will use the Vote Counting Direction of Effect method to manage expected data heterogeneity, assessing whether ENDS use is beneficial or detrimental, or has no effect on respiratory functions based on the pattern of use.\n\n\n<span>Results:</span>The review is expected to be completed by December 2024. The database search was concluded in April 2024, and data extraction and bias assessment were completed in June 2024. The analysis phase is planned to be completed by October 2024.\n\n\n<span>Conclusions:</span>A thorough and comprehensive assessment of the evidence will better inform the contentious debate over the respiratory effects of ENDS providing much needed clarity by linking their effects to specific usage patterns. This analysis is particularly crucial in understanding the risks associated with continued cigarette smoking.\n\n\n<span>Trial Registration:</span>PROSPERO CRD42024540034; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=540034\n\n\n<span>International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID):</span>DERR1-10.2196/60325\n\n\n<strong>JMIR Res Protoc 2024;13:e60325</strong>\n\n\nContents:\n - resprot-2024-1-e60325.pdf",

In this study, we combined two approaches: the rule-based MT approach and the statistical MT approach. Sentence reordering, Language model, Translation models, and decoding comprise the system. POS tagging was used to reorder the sentence more comparably, the IRSTLM tool was used to create language models for English, and the Wolaytta, Giza++ tool was used for translation. To ensure mutual translation, two language models have been developed. Four phases of experiments are carried out on the collected dataset. Phases of experimentation include preprocessing on the parallel corpus, language modelling, training the translation model, and tuning the translation system. For both side translations, the BLEU score assessed the translation accuracy from Wolaytta to English as 46.31 % and from English to Wolaytta as 56.56%.\n\n\nContents:\n - B102814020125.pdf",

This article examines how teaching and learning resources are used in addition to mathematics in order to comprehend teachers' perspectives towards the usage of resources in the chosen school. The purpose of this study, which focused only on primary schools, was to ascertain how teaching and learning resources were applied in the teaching of mathematics and how such applications impacted the learning results of the learners. Using a qualitative approach, the study collected data from primary school teachers via focus groups, interviews, and classroom observations. Using participatory action research, the utilization of teaching and learning resources in mathematics in primary school classes was thoroughly investigated. Teaching and learning resources have become a prevalent trend in educational contexts as a means of increasing learners' motivation and participation. The results assisted in identifying challenges such as time constraints, large class sizes, teacher knowledge and skills, concerns about the appropriate use of resources, concerns about financial constraints, and a lack of professional development opportunities and training for teachers. They also provided recommendations for improving the effective use of resources in primary school mathematics teaching. However, the study focused on how resources would facilitate group learning, promote learner involvement, and provide tailored teaching. The results of this investigation thus provided valuable information regarding the usage of instructional resources and learning materials in primary school mathematics classes, as well as any potential effects on learners' learning outcomes in addition. It is advised that all school leaders get familiar with the resources available for teaching and learning. In addition to setting up support systems for teachers and head teachers, the government is also expected to educate administrators about the programme.\n\n\nContents:\n - 2.pdf",

The fossil record of stegosaurian cranial material is remarkably fragmentary and scarce. This study describes the most complete stegosaurian skull from Europe and proposes a new hypothesis for the phylogenetic relationships of stegosaurs. This new cranial material was recovered from beds of the Villar del Arzobispo Formation (Upper Jurassic, Teruel, Spain) and is confidently referred to <i>Dacentrurus armatus</i>. It provides valuable insights into the anatomy of this species and enhances the understanding of skull evolution in stegosaurs. Furthermore, the diagnosis of <i>D. armatus</i> is updated with the identification of a new autapomorphy. Stegosaurian phylogenetic nomenclature is also revised. Maximum Parsimony has been applied to analyse a new stegosaurian data matrix. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that Stegosauria is divided into two major clades: Huayangosauridae and Stegosauridae. These analyses support <i>Isaberrysaura mollensis</i> as a stegosaur and place it within Huayangosauridae, a clade that also includes several Jurassic stegosaurs from Asia. For the first time, <i>Mongolostegus exspectabilis</i> is included in a phylogenetic analysis, the results of which suggests that a lineage of huayangosaurids or early-diverging stegosaurids persisted in Asia until at least the late Early Cretaceous. The new tree topologies challenge the synonymization of the genera <i>Stegosaurus</i> and <i>Wuerhosaurus</i>. Moreover, it is concluded that a taxonomic re-evaluation of Early Cretaceous Chinese stegosaurs is necessary. <i>Alcovasaurus longispinus</i> and <i>Kentrosaurus aethiopicus</i> are recovered as dacentrurines.\n\n\nContents:\n - VZ_article_146618.pdf",

This research employs a literature study approach with content analysis techniques applied to various relevant journals, books, and scientific articles. The findings indicate that the field study learning method provides contextual and authentic learning experiences that can enhance students&rsquo; practical skills, conceptual understanding, and professional attitudes. On the other hand, learning motivation is an internal psychological factor that drives students&rsquo; active engagement in the learning process and contributes to optimal learning outcomes.

Our approach integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture the spatial and temporal features of ISL gestures effectively. The CNN component extracts rich visual features from the input sign language videos, while the LSTM component models the dynamic temporal patterns inherent in the gesture sequences. We evaluated our system using a comprehensive ISL dataset of 700 fully annotated videos representing 100 spoken language sentences. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we compared two model architectures: CNN-LSTM and SVM-LSTM. The CNN-LSTM model achieved a training accuracy of 84%, demonstrating superior performance in capturing visual and sequential information. In contrast, the SVM-LSTM model achieved a training accuracy of 66%, indicating comparatively lower effectiveness in this context. One of the key challenges faced during the development of the system was overfitting, primarily due to computational constraints and the limited size of the dataset. Nevertheless, the model exhibited promising results through careful tuning of hyperparameters and various optimisation strategies, suggesting its potential for real-world applications. This paper also discusses the data preprocessing techniques employed, including video frame extraction, normalisation, and data augmentation, which were critical in enhancing model performance. By addressing the complexities of sign language recognition, our work advances communication accessibility for individuals relying on ISL, promoting greater inclusivity through technology.\n\n\nContents:\n - B366815020525.pdf",

    "raw_description": "Soybean (<em>Glycine max</em> (L.) is an important staple and industrial crop grown in tropical, subtropical and temperate regions of the world. However, its production is constrained by incessant weed competition for nutrient, water and sunlight which reduces output. To minimize the impact of weed competition, this study assessed the effectiveness of different weed management regimes. Soybean seeds were sown in two (2) locations of Delta State (Asaba and Ozoro), and the weed management regimes were T1: No weeding, T2: weeding 3 weeks after planting, T3: weeding 3, 6 weeks after planting, T4: weeding, 3, 6, 9 weeks after planting, and T5: weeding all through. The experiment was a 2 (location) by 5 (weeding regimes) factorial arranged in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) and replicated three times. Data were collected on the agronomic and number of pods produced. Data collected were analysed using analysis of variance and means were separated using least significant differences. At 12 weeks after planting, the plant height, number of leaves and number of pods produced differed significantly and ranged from 24.33&plusmn;1.02 (Asaba) to 41.46&plusmn;1.02 (Ozoro), 21.47&plusmn;1.69 (Asaba) to 48.10&plusmn;1.69 (Ozoro), and 15.25&plusmn;1.39 (Asaba) to 24.44&plusmn;1.39 (Ozoro) between locations, and ranged from 31.90&plusmn;1.90 (T2) to 37.97&plusmn;1.90 (T5), 23.93&plusmn;3.18 (T1) to 41.63&plusmn;3.18 (T5), and 12.78&plusmn;2.62 (T1) to 25.01&plusmn;2.62 (T5) amongst the treatments.

The BrentKung adder is our go-to for fast addition and subtraction. Thanks to its clever parallel-prefix structure, it minimises delays even as the numbers get bigger. For multiplication, we turn to the radix-4 Booth multiplier. This powerhouse streamlines the multiplication process by cutting down the number of partial products and operations needed, efficiently handling both positive and negative numbers. By integrating these components, our FPU can handle floating-point arithmetic with excellent efficiency and reliability. In scientific computing, this means more accurate simulations and data analyses. For graphics processing, it translates to better image rendering and smoother visual effects.

The dietary treatments were: 100% fresh corn stover, a 50:50 mix of fresh corn stover and corn stover silage, and 100% corn stover silage. Data analysis was performed using ANOVA, and significant results were further examined with Duncan&rsquo;s Multiple Range Test (DMRT). The findings indicated that none of the treatments had a significant impact on the digestibility of Dry Matter (DMD), Organic Matter (OMD), or Crude Protein (CPD). It was concluded that the diet containing an equal mix of fresh and silage corn stover yielded the most favorable outcomes, although overall digestibility did not differ significantly across treatments. Consequently, corn stover silage with FML additives may serve as a practical alternative to fresh corn stover.\n\n\nContents:\n - 65-2805-2025.pdf",

We review how AI is currently used in libraries (e.g. recommender systems, automated cataloging, chatbots, and user analytics) and analyze the ethical challenges and risks these applications pose, including data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, and the opacity of AI decision-making. Based on recent literature and guidelines, we reflect on the implications of adopting AI in information access environments, arguing that libraries must align AI deployment with core values such as intellectual freedom, equity of access, and user privacy. Analyzing ten recent scholarly sources, this paper underscores the need for ethical AI strategies in libraries.

As a result, the landscape of protected areas such as the Dinderesso Classified Forest is highly heterogeneous. The overall objective was to assess the performance of machine learning algorithms in better mapping the land use classes of the Dinderesso Classified Forest. To do this, a Sentinel-2 image and information collected in the field were used. The Sentinel-2 image was classified using Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms. 850 regions of interest were selected for model training and validation. Random Forest performed best, with a Kappa coefficient of 91.49% compared with 90.17% for Support Vector Machine. The F-score for the Bare land and Agroforestry parks class was the highest (0.98) and the Gallery and Dense Vegetation class had the lowest F-score (0.82). Both algorithms showed high levels of performance, so they are suitable for classifying heterogeneous landscapes. The proportion of the Bare land and Agroforestry parks class was 29.29% compared with 70.71% for the natural formation classes (shrub savannahs, tree savannahs, Gallery, and Dense Vegetation). Given the level of anthropization of the Classified Forest, measures need to be taken to limit this process to conserve biodiversity.\n\n\npublished by the&nbsp;<strong> <a href=\"https://innspub.net/journal-of-biodiversity-and-environmental-sciences/\">Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences (JBES)</a></strong>\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\nContents:\n - JBES-V25-No4-p122-131.pdf",

Dyn pinches-off vesicles at the plasma membrane and mediates uptake of many viruses, although some viruses directly penetrate the plasma membrane. RME is classically interrogated by genetic and pharmacological interference, but this has been hampered by undesired effects. Here we studied virus entry in conditional genetic knock-out (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking expression of all three&nbsp;dynamin isoforms (Dyn-KO-MEFs). The small canine parvovirus known to use a single&nbsp;receptor, transferrin receptor, strictly depended on dynamin. Larger viruses or viruses&nbsp;known to use multiple receptors, including alphaviruses, influenza, vesicular stomatitis,&nbsp;bunya, adeno, vaccinia, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)&nbsp;and rhinoviruses infected Dyn-KO-MEFs, albeit at higher dosage than wild-type MEFs. In&nbsp;absence of the transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (TMPRSS2), which normally activates the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for plasma membrane fusion, SARS-CoV-2 infected angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-expressing MEFs predominantly through dynamin- and actin-dependent endocytosis. In presence of TMPRSS2 the ancestral Wuhanstrain bypassed both dynamin-dependent and -independent endocytosis, and was less sensitive to endosome maturation inhibitors than the Omicron B1 and XBB variants, supporting the notion that the Omicron variants do not efficiently use TMPRSS2. Collectively, our study&nbsp;suggests that dynamin function at endocytic pits can be essential for infection with single-receptor viruses, while it is not essential but increases uptake and infection efficiency of&nbsp;multi-receptor viruses that otherwise rely on a functional actin network for infection.\n\n\nContents:\n - journal.ppat_.1012690.pdf",

    "raw_description": "<em><span>Energy harvesting from ambient sources is an innovative technology that enables self-powered electronic systems by converting naturally available energy into usable electrical power. This approach reduces reliance on conventional batteries, extending device lifetimes and minimizing environmental impact. Key energy sources for harvesting include solar radiation, thermal gradients, and radio frequency (RF) waves, each with unique advantages and challenges. Solar energy, harnessed through photovoltaic (PV) cells, is highly efficient in outdoor environments and has seen advancements in thin-film and perovskite materials for improved low-light performance. Thermal energy harvesting, using thermoelectric generators (TEGs), efficiently converts temperature differences into electricity, making it ideal for industrial waste heat recovery and wearable electronics. RF energy harvesting captures ambient electromagnetic waves from Wi-Fi, cellular networks, and radio transmissions, enabling low-power IoT devices and remote sensors to function without wired power sources. However, each of these energy sources faces limitations, such as efficiency degradation, environmental dependency, and restricted power output, requiring innovative solutions to enhance their practical applications.</span></em>\n\n\n<em><span>To overcome these limitations, hybrid energy harvesting systems integrate multiple sources to improve power availability and reliability. By combining solar, thermal, and RF energy, these systems can ensure continuous energy supply, even in fluctuating environmental conditions. Technologies like solar-thermal hybrids maximize energy extraction by utilizing both light and heat, while RF-solar hybrids supplement solar power with ambient electromagnetic waves. Additionally, advanced power management techniques, including maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms and energy-efficient storage solutions such as supercapacitors and micro-batteries, further optimize harvested energy for electronic applications. Future advancements in high-efficiency materials, miniaturized components, and AI-driven power optimization will play a crucial role in developing self-sustaining electronic devices. As energy harvesting technology continues to evolve, it holds the potential to revolutionize IoT, wearable electronics, and industrial applications, providing a sustainable and long-lasting power solution for modern electronics.</span></em>\n\n\nContents:\n - S0622158.pdf",

As both disciplines aim to perform measurements pushing the limits of precision, the effective control and mitigation of environmental and quantum-originated noise pose a critical challenge. In this context, the quantum squeezing technique stands out as a fundamental tool in both domains, employed to reduce measurement uncertainty below the quantum limit in GW detectors and to enhance the sensitivity of quantum bits (qubits) in QCs. Carlton Caves' pioneering 1980 paper [1] first theoretically established the inevitable presence of quantum mechanical radiation pressure fluctuations in laser interferometers and their impact on measurement sensitivity, thereby laying the groundwork for integrating quantum optics principles into high-precision metrology. This theoretical framework has also provided the intellectual basis for quantum noise reduction strategies developed to enhance the sensitivity of GW detectors. Similarly, Peter Shor's development of quantum error correction (QEC) codes in 1996 [3] represented a landmark, offering a solution to decoherence and operational errors&mdash;one of the biggest obstacles for QCs&mdash;and paving the way for scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computation. The present work meticulously compares the parallel technological advancements and conceptual intersections in these two pioneering fields, highlighting a rich interdisciplinary potential that can yield mutual benefits and inspire innovative solutions. In this vein, the study analyses the historical evolution and current technological challenges of both GW observations and QCs, while also envisioning potential future areas of interaction and collaboration&mdash;such as advanced sensors, novel signal processing algorithms, and the application of quantum information theory to physical systems&mdash;thereby aiming to establish a solid foundation for a deeper and more fruitful integration of quantum technologies in these two distinct yet complementary domains.</span>\n\n\n<span lang=\"EN-GB\">&nbsp;</span>\n\n\n<span lang=\"EN-GB\">&nbsp;</span>\n\n\n<strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Keywords: </span></strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Gravitational Waves, Quantum Computing, Quantum Squeezing, Noise Suppression, Quantum Error Correction, QEC, Interferometry, Interdisciplinary Science, Quantum Optics, LIGO, Shor's Algorithm<strong>.</strong></span>\n\n\nContents:\n - The Relationship Between Gravitational Wave Observations and Quantum Computing Technologies-27052025-0.pdf",

    "raw_description": "The TP53 gene encodes the critical tumor suppressor p53, which is involved in the regulation of cell cycle control, apoptosis, and genomic stability. In cancer biology, p53 holds an elevated position because high mutation rates in the TP53 gene across human cancers lead to abnormal p53 protein. This would allow limitless replication of genetically damaged cells with malignant potential and so facilitate tumorigenesis. Normally referred to as the &ldquo;guardian of the genome,&rdquo; this protein assumes a central role in different cellular functions spanning metabolism through cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis to DNA repair mechanisms. Its significance extends beyond tumor suppression because it controls metabolic pathways that are central to maintaining homeostasis under normal physiological conditions. The normal functions of p53 as a tumor suppressor are abrogated by mutations; indeed, many such mutant forms act as oncogenes themselves when expressed in cancer cells. The review paper presents information from recent scientific investigations on the chemical structure of p53 protein and its mutations with a discussion on implications for cancer treatment. It also integrates various research findings to clarify the clinical effects of the p53 gene, especially in breast cancer and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and looks into changing treatment plans that focus on p53 problems.\n\n\nContents:\n - 10.pdf",

By incorporating advanced digital communication technologies, Real-time monitoring, automatic control, and the smooth integration of renewable energy sources are made possible by smart grids. These grids rely on interconnected components such as smart meters, sensors, and data analytics platforms to optimize power distribution and consumption. However, this increased digitalization also introduces significant cybersecurity risks, making smart grids a prime target for cyber-attacks.</span></em>\n\n\n<em><span>Because cyber threats targeting smart grids are constantly changing, traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) like signature-based and rule-based procedures find it difficult to keep up. Attackers are always coming up with new and advanced ways to take advantage of weaknesses in the grid infrastructure, including as malware, phishing and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Furthermore, it is difficult for traditional IDS to efficiently assess and identify threats in real time due to the large volume and diversity of data produced by smart grid components. The dependability of conventional security measures is further diminished by false positives and false negatives, which can result in either excessive warnings or undiscovered breaches.</span></em>\n\n\n<em><span>Deep learning-based intrusion detection provides a flexible and clever method of protecting smart grids in order to overcome these difficulties. Deep learning models, in contrast to traditional IDS, have the ability to automatically discover patterns in enormous volumes of data, spot irregularities, and find attack vectors that haven't been discovered yet. Convolutional neural networks i.e CNN and long short-term memory i.e LSTM in particular has demonstrated encouraging outcomes in accurately identifying cyber attacks [1]. Deep learning models offer a proactive protection mechanism versus cyber threats in smart grid environments by continuously learning from changing attack patterns.</span></em>\n\n\n<em><span>This research paper investigates the use of deep learning-based intrusion detection systems for smart grids. A study's main objectives are to analyze real-time smart grid data, train neural network models to identify cyber intrusions, and assess how well they operate in different assault scenarios. By lowering false positives, increasing detection accuracy, and guaranteeing the energy infrastructure's resilience against changing threats, the suggested method seeks to improve cybersecurity in smart grids.

They invest in companies, pretending to support innovation, but their real goal is to hide illegal money and make profits without getting caught. The paper explains how the Mafia provides funding to startups in exchange for using them as a way to launder money. They also take advantage of cryptocurrency because it allows them to make secret transactions without being traced. These activities create serious problems, such as unfair competition, a lack of trust among investors, and difficulties for the government in making proper rules. Because technology is growing faster than laws can keep up, criminals find new ways to exploit the system.

In the Vedas, water was revered both as a feminine entity and, in some hymns, as a divine lord. Depending on its diverse functions and attributes, ancient sages invoked water under different names.</span>\n\n\n<span>Water is the essence of life, a sustaining force that protects both the living and the departed. It is considered the primary source of energy and existence. Vedic texts classify water into two categories: terrestrial and celestial. Various water deities, such as Indra and Parjanya, are associated with its divine aspects. The Vedas are regarded as the ultimate source of wisdom. According to Vedic texts, before creation took place, the universe was filled with dormant cosmic particles containing inherent potential for activity. Ancient Vedic sages, possessing profound wisdom and a highly scientific perspective, deeply analyzed the fundamental forces of creation. Through their refined intellect and investigative approach, they studied the energy dynamics in the universe, including the five gross elements one of which is water. Water is identified as a crucial energy element in the process of creation. This research paper highlights the vital role of water as depicted in Vedic scriptures.

GST aimed to unify the complex and fragmented indirect tax system, replacing multiple state and central taxes with a single tax structure. It was designed to eliminate the cascading effect of taxes, simplify compliance, and create a common national market. Despite its objectives, the implementation of GST faced several challenges, including technological issues, compliance difficulties, and revenue shortfalls for manufacturing states. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the GST framework, including its structure, implementation challenges, economic impact, and benefits. It also compares India&rsquo;s GST model with similar tax systems in other countries, examines the effect on different sectors, and proposes recommendations for improvement. A case study on the automobile industry highlights the impact of GST on business and consumer behavior.

    "raw_description": "Horizon 2020 (H2020), the EU&rsquo;s flagship research and innovation programme (2014&ndash;2020), made&nbsp;gender equality a cross-cutting issue, with a strong focus on integrating the gender dimension into&nbsp;research and innovation content. This approach was rooted in the recognition that both biological (sex)&nbsp;and socio-cultural (gender) differences influence research outcomes and innovation processes, and&nbsp;that addressing these differences enriches scientific results, enhances societal relevance, and&nbsp;supports responsible research.\n\n\nThe EU&rsquo;s commitment to gender equality in research has evolved from addressing the&nbsp;underrepresentation of women in science to a broader strategy that includes integrating gender&nbsp;analysis into research and innovation content. This shift was formalized in key policy documents,&nbsp;including the Amsterdam Treaty (1999), the Europe 2020 Strategy, and the European Research Area&nbsp;(ERA) Communication (2012), which established gender equality and mainstreaming as priorities for&nbsp;fostering scientific excellence and innovation.\n\n\nHorizon 2020 operationalized gender equality through three main objectives:\n\n<ol>\n<li>Fostering Gender Balance in Project Teams: Promoting equal opportunities and closing\nparticipation gaps for women in research teams.</li>\n<li>Ensuring Gender Balance in Decision-Making: Setting targets for the underrepresented sex\nin panels (40%) and advisory groups (50%).</li>\n<li>Integrating the Gender Dimension in Research and Innovation Content: Requiring\nresearchers to consider sex and gender analysis in research questions, methodologies, and\noutcomes.</li>\n</ol>\n\nThe implementation of the integration of the gender dimension in research and innovation content is&nbsp;defined in the legal and strategic framework of H2020. Specifically,, Article 16 of the H2020 Regulation&nbsp;mandated the effective promotion of gender equality and the integration of the gender dimension in&nbsp;research and innovation content, to be addressed at all stages of the research cycle. Many calls were&nbsp;&ldquo;gender-flagged&rdquo; to highlight this requirement.\n\n\nApplicants were required to describe in their proposals how sex and/or gender analysis was relevant&nbsp;to their research. The European Commission supported applicants with different documents like best&nbsp;practice reports, guidelines etc. providing insights and guidance on this topic. To strengthen the&nbsp;implementation of the gender dimension across the whole programme each thematic advisory group&nbsp;needed to include gender experts who provided guidance on integrating the gender dimension and&nbsp;monitored progress. The inclusion of the gender dimension was part of the proposal evaluation criteria,&nbsp;reinforcing its importance for scientific excellence and impact.\n\n\nH2020 distinguished between &lsquo;sex&rsquo; (biological characteristics) and &lsquo;gender&rsquo; (socio-cultural factors),&nbsp;and emphasized the importance of analyzing both to avoid bias and ensure that research benefits all&nbsp;segments of society.\n\n\nBy mainstreaming the gender dimension in research and innovation, Horizon 2020 aimed to foster&nbsp;more inclusive, relevant, and high-quality research outcomes, while advancing the EU&rsquo;s broader goals&nbsp;of equality and innovation-driven growth.\n\n\nHorizon 2020 (H2020) was the first EU framework programme to make gender a cross-cutting issue,&nbsp;embedding the integration of the gender dimension into research and innovation content as a core&nbsp;objective. This meant that applicants were encouraged&mdash;and in many cases required&mdash;to consider&nbsp;how sex and gender differences affect research questions, design, methodologies, and outcomes&nbsp;across all project stages. The rationale was that integrating gender analysis improves the scientific&nbsp;quality and societal relevance of knowledge, technologies, and innovations produced, leading to&nbsp;results that better address the needs and behaviors of both women and men. H2020 recognized that&nbsp;without this dimension, research risks being partial or biased, and may fail to deliver effective solutions&nbsp;for all users. As a result, many topics in the H2020 work programme were \"gender-flagged,\" and the&nbsp;inclusion of a gender dimension was evaluated as part of project excellence, helping to drive more&nbsp;inclusive and impactful research and innovation across Europe.\n\n\nContents:\n - D3.10 Case3 - H2020.pdf",

    "raw_description": "Just as violence is a part of human nature and cannot be avoided, it has also been present in movies since the beginning of this art form, and it has been the subject of attention and study by various thinkers. Since violence has been evident in many films from the early years of cinema, most of us neglect to understand the amazing complexities and unexplored issues of its representation. One of these complications is understanding the effect of technologies on the representation of violence. Representation of violence in cinema is often studied from psychological and sociological perspectives, but few researchers have paid attention to the effect of technological developments on the representation of violence in cinema. The purpose of this research, which was carried out in a descriptive-analytical way, is to study the effect of technological developments on the representation of violence in the history of cinema. Obviously, the representation of violence in cinema has changed according to the changes and developments of technology. In a general classification, violence represented in the history of cinema can be divided into four periods, each of which is separated from its former era, by a fundamental technological evolution in this field. These evolutions are in the order of talking cinema, the colorization of cinematography and the digitization of cinema, each of which has brought about a fundamental transformation in the representation of violence. Among the scientific definitions of the concept of violence, in this research, the division of Mark Vorobej is used, he classifies violence in three forms: a) physical violence, b) psychological violence , and c) structural violence. Vorobej also categorizes the definitions of violence in the following five main topics, which can be considered as the five basic \"dimensions\" of the phenomenon of violence that exist in every violent act: 1) harming, 2) agency, 3) victimization/being, 4) instrumentality and 5) normativity. In order to understand and analyze the effects of technological developments in cinema, the opinions of \"Don Ihde\", a prominent expert in the field of philosophy of technology, have been used to explain the relationship between violent actions as human actions and technology. By stating that technology mediates human perception of the world, Ihde introduces four types of relationships that humans establish with the world in the presence of technology. The point that Ihde cared about from the beginning is that technology changes perception, so cinema changes our perception of violent action, and when violence is represented in cinema, we simultaneously understand the tool as cinema, and the violent act for itself. This is why the representation of violence is changing due to the evolution of technology.\nThe findings of this research show that technologies, while transforming the representation of violence, are also a part of represented acts of violence. Furthermore, comparing the representation of violence in different eras, according to Ihde's opinions, shows the relative closeness of what is represented by cinematic technology in accordance to the time when the violent actions occur in the absence of cinema technology.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\nContents:\n - Sheikhmehdi.pdf",

We have extended original Optimized Linked State Routing (OLSR) protocol by using two algorithms and named it as Enhancement in OLSR using Residual Energy approach (EOLSR-RE) and Enhancement in OLSR using Energy Consumption approach (EOLSR-EC). To analyze relative performance of modified protocol EOLSR-RE and EOLSR-EC over OLSR, we performed various trials using Qualnet simulator. The performance of these routing protocols is analyzed in terms of energy consumption, control overheads, end to end delay, packet delivery ratio. The modified OLSR protocol improves energy efficiency of network by reducing 20 % energy consumption and 50% control overheads.</span>\n\n\nContents:\n - 1011ijans03.pdf",
